### Insights from On-the-Ground Contributors
  * ![](https://www.china-briefing.com/assets/images/quote-cb-icon.svg?v2)Hong Kong has long held a reputation as a popular “gateway” to invest in China. Its geographical proximity to the mainland, DTA network, modern banking system and transparent legal regime have made it an ideal location for foreign businesses. However, companies will quickly discover that the rules of doing business in the mainland simply do not apply in Hong Kong, and vice versa - making it important to understand the nuances of doing business here. 
![profile⟨79⟩]
**Alberto Vettoretti** Managing Partner  Hong Kong SAR Office
  * ![](https://www.china-briefing.com/assets/images/quote-cb-icon.svg?v2)Leveraging Hong Kong's role in Asian economy will provide investors with numerous opportunities for growth. Understanding the intricacies of operating a business in Hong Kong is the key to success in this market. Foreign investors should pay close attention to the developments in Hong Kong - including regulatory changes, tax reforms, and proposed incentives – to stay up to date with market practices, as well as legal and regulatory compliances. 
![profile⟨80⟩]
**Gigi Wong** Manager  Hong Kong SAR Office
  * ![](https://www.china-briefing.com/assets/images/quote-cb-icon.svg?v2)Investing in Hong Kong not only grants access to a skilled and highly educated workforce but it’s low and simple tax regime, along with its robust intellectual property protections, fosters innovation and entrepreneurship. It's an ideal destination for businesses looking to optimize their tax structure and protect their intellectual assets while expanding in Asia.

# Doing Business Without an Entity in Hong Kong
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/company-establishment/doing-business-without-an-entity-in-hong-kong)
## Getting your business started in Hong Kong faster.
Businesses typically go through the time-consuming, costly, and risky steps of setting up a corporate entity⟨11⟩, sourcing local talent⟨19⟩, and maneuvering intricate local regulations and operational complexities to expand or establish their international footprint.
  

Contributing Advisor
The mentioned traditional market entry strategy might result in:
  * Opting for an unsuitable pricing model; 
  * Launching an off-target initial service line or product; 
  * Setting up in the wrong location, adopting an incompatible business model; or 
  * Designate the unbefitting business partners or suppliers to work with. 


Considering Hong Kong’s complex labor laws⟨18⟩, many companies increasingly recognize the benefits of initially exploring a limited, short-term presence in Hong Kong. Fortunately, an alternative and less conventional approach exists, offering businesses a means to mitigate the risks associated with market entry across various Asian markets.
Global Staffing Solutions enables foreign investors to do business in China for short-term durations without a legal entity of their own as an alternative.
## Global PEO service in Hong Kong: What is it, and how does it work?
Professional employer organizations, often called global EOR (Employer of Record), will act as human resources⟨33⟩ providers for businesses that opt to set up without an entity in Hong Kong.
Did You Know
PEO will facilitate hiring globally, support your company's remote teams, and expand your presence.
PEO allows a company to scale its operations by hiring global talents lawfully and economically while the company focuses on core business functions instead.
## PEO Benefits
Incorporating a company⟨10⟩ in Hong Kong can be complex and potentially costly if you need to familiarize yourself with the process. However, a lesser-known method offers your company similar advantages without the need for full incorporation—a Professional Employer Organization (PEO).
Here are some benefits PEO will provide you with;
  * **(1) risk mitigation** by regulations compliance since Hong Kong labor laws are strict, complex, and ever-changing. PEO will help shoulder the legal responsibilities when hiring globally, enabling your company to support remote teams and broaden its international footprint effectively;
  * **(2) time and cost savings** by avoiding the conventional bottlenecks of setting up a business in Hong Kong, including costly expenses. Reduce your company’s administrative costs by streamlining workforce processes;
  * **(3) local expertise and networks** where you gain access to invaluable local expertise and well-established networks, which can be instrumental in navigating the complexities of the Hong Kong market and empower your business expansion.

A Hong Kong-based company can be legally formed without a physical presence⟨70⟩, allowing for remote operations with no physical office or on-site staff.

Further, if the company generates all of its income⟨24⟩ from sources outside Hong Kong, it will not be subject to taxation⟨23⟩ within the region.
Offshore companies⟨15⟩ offer enhanced flexibility and substantial cost savings, thanks to their more relaxed regulations and reduced operational expenses. Conversely, onshore companies enjoy heightened legitimacy in the eyes of Hong Kong authorities and seamless access to the local market. The choice between opting for an offshore or onshore company fundamentally depends on a business owner's specific requirements and the objectives for their business.

![Offshore Status of Hong Kong Companies⟨69⟩]
# Offshore Status of Hong Kong Companies
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/company-establishment/offshore-status-of-hong-kong-companies)
A Hong Kong-based company can be legally formed without a physical presence, allowing for remote operations with no physical office⟨70⟩ or on-site staff. If the company generates all of its income from sources outside Hong Kong, it will not be subject to taxation⟨23⟩ within the region.
  

Contributing Advisor
Consider the following distinctions between offshore and onshore companies in Hong Kong for better comprehension:
## Offshore and onshore companies’ comparison table
Offshore companies |  Onshore companies  
---|---  
Comply with legal requirements by filing audited financial statements and holding annual general meetings. |  Obliged to submit audited financial statements and conduct annual general meetings following the Hong Kong law.  
Enjoy tax exemptions through offshore claims. |  Only a few tax exemptions are available;  
No taxes are imposed on profits, capital gains, or overseas dividends. |  Subject to a 16.5 percent corporate tax on overseas profits, capital gains, and dividends.  
Prohibited from engaging in trade with Hong Kong customers or conducting business within Hong Kong. |  Allowed to conduct business with Hong Kong customers and operate within Hong Kong.  
Offshore companies offer enhanced flexibility and substantial cost savings, thanks to their more relaxed regulations and reduced operational expenses.

Conversely, onshore companies enjoy heightened legitimacy in the eyes of Hong Kong authorities and seamless access to the local market. The choice between opting for an offshore or onshore company fundamentally depends on a business owner's specific requirements and the objectives they aspire to accomplish.
Typically, two widely used tests are used to ascertain a company's offshore status to determine whether the company will be subject to taxation within the region. The following tests are:
## Contract effected test
The contract effected test is used for determining the taxability of the income accruing to the taxpayer from trading transactions. The critical factor is whether the purchase or sale contract is made in Hong Kong. It includes negotiation, conclusion, and execution of the contract terms. The following factors should also be taken into consideration:
  * How were the goods shipped?
  * How were the sales solicited and orders processed?
  * How were the goods procured and stored?
  * How was financing arranged?
  * How was the payment made?


## Operations test
The operations test pertains to scenarios beyond trading and money lending, encompassing sources like manufacturing income and passive earnings. When seeking tax exemptions⟨26⟩ for commission income, it's essential to address the following inquiries:
  * What is the primary source of income?
  * Did this source originate within Hong Kong?
  * What activities were undertaken to generate profits, and where were they conducted?


In the context of obtaining offshore status, it is crucial for businesses to take into consideration the following prerequisites:
  * Absence of a physical, operational presence in Hong Kong.
  * Absence of locally hired staff working in Hong Kong.
  * Lack of customers or clients originating from Hong Kong.
  * Absence of suppliers based in Hong Kong.
  * Negotiation and finalization of sales and purchase contracts occurring outside of Hong Kong.
  * Non-importation of goods into Hong Kong.
  * Ensure that service agreements or sales/purchase invoices do not involve any parties located in Hong Kong.
  * The core business activities must occur outside of Hong Kong.


Once these fundamental conditions are met, the tax authority will review the supporting documentation to determine the company's tax liability⟨24⟩. It is important to note that after obtaining the exemption, the company is still required to maintain annual accounting and audit reports⟨32⟩ and file tax returns in its jurisdictions outside of Hong Kong.
Did You Know
It is common for the tax authority to wait two to three years before questioning companies regarding their offshore status. At that point, the company should prepare for a review of their books starting from incorporation.
Documentary pieces of evidence including, but not limited to, the following documents, are critical to the success of the claim:
  * **Organizational Chart:** Provide a detailed organizational chart outlining your company's presence in Hong Kong and overseas. This chart should include the office locations, sizes, number of employees, names, job titles, responsibilities, and compensation packages.
  * **Travel Itinerary and Passports:** The travel schedules and passport information for the directors and individuals involved in the Hong Kong company's operations.
  * **Business Activities Description:** Specify the responsible person and where these activities were conducted for each identified activity to substantiate the income generation and describe the company's operational activities.
  * **High-Income Documentation:** For high-income segments, it's essential to provide the following documents:
  * **Communication Records:** Include all correspondence related to negotiations with customers and suppliers, encompassing emails, faxes, and similar documentation.
  * **Agreements:** Share any distribution agreements or master sales agreements, if applicable.
  * **Transaction Records:** Include purchase and sales orders, confirmations, shipping documents, and sales and purchase invoices.
  * **Banking Records:** Submit any pertinent banking documents that support income claims.


## Annual compliance requirements for an offshore company
### Business registration renewal
Stay compliant by renewing the Business Registration Certificate annually or triennially, ensuring it's renewed before the renewal deadline, normally within 1 month of the anniversary date.
### Accounting Bookkeeping
Store your company's accounting records at the registered office for at least seven years after each fiscal year, ensuring ongoing adherence to regulatory requirements to maintain compliance and streamline audits.
### Records maintenance
Maintain records of entity details, past members, meetings, and single-member decisions at your registered office.
### Profits tax return
Companies formed under Cap 622 must submit their profit tax⟨24⟩ returns to the IRD, including supplementary forms if necessary, within one month of the issue date and pay the tax within one month of the filing deadline unless exempted.
### Annual return
Every business must submit an annual return to the Companies Registry within 42 days of its formation anniversary, signed by an authorized representative.

# Setting Up a Family Office in Hong Kong
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/company-establishment/setting-up-a-family-office-in-hong-kong)
**_Hong Kong's strategic location, robust financial infrastructure, favorable tax regime, and high quality of life make it an ideal destination for establishing family offices, offering comprehensive support for wealth management and long-term family planning._**
* * *
[promote-webinar url="https://www.dezshira.com/events/details/enhancing-your-accounting-capability-ai-introduction-xero-smes.html"]
Hong Kong's family office sector has seen remarkable growth, with a recent market study revealing that over 2,700 single-family offices were 
Historically, Hong Kong's role in managing family wealth dates back to the late 1800s, and it has evolved into one of Asia's largest cross-border wealth management centers. The recent surge in family offices can be attributed to the city's strategic initiatives, including the development of a world-class family office regime. The Hong Kong government's ongoing efforts to attract more family offices have led to new policies and incentives, reinforcing the city's status as a premier destination for global family offices. 
Hong Kong is a premier location for establishing a family office due to its strategic access to Asia's markets, favorable tax regime, and robust financial services, complemented by a high quality of life. 
In this article, we explore the key factors that shape Hong Kong’s family office sector and outline the steps to establish a family office in Hong Kong. 
[portal-ads country="hongkong"]
## What is a family office?
A family office is a specialized entity designed to manage the wealth and needs of high-net-worth individuals and families. By consolidating investments and financial management under one roof, a family office provides greater control, transparency, and efficiency. This is particularly crucial as we approach a significant intergenerational wealth transfer, with an estimated US$8 trillion expected to change hands by 2029, according to Credit Suisse. 
Family offices vary in structure, typically tailored to the specific needs of the family. Commonly, they involve a holding company or investment vehicles within a trust, centralizing financial operations and bringing dedicated expertise in-house. This setup also offers younger generations a platform to gain experience in investment management and business operations, preparing them to manage family wealth in the future. 
Beyond financial management, family offices often cover estate planning, philanthropy, and concierge services, ensuring comprehensive management of the family's wealth and lifestyle. 
## Why choose Hong Kong to set up a family office?
Hong Kong is an attractive destination for establishing a family office, offering strategic access to Asia's dynamic markets, especially Mainland China and the broader Asia-Pacific region. As a global wealth hub, Hong Kong ranks among the top financial centers, second only to Switzerland in assets under management. Its deep capital markets, well-established banking and legal systems, and extensive network of skilled professionals provide family offices with a strong foundation for wealth management and growth.

The city’s favorable tax regime is a major draw, featuring no sales tax, VAT, or capital gains tax, and no withholding tax on dividends or interest. Recent tax concessions specifically for family offices further enhance Hong Kong’s appeal, especially in comparison to hubs like Singapore, Switzerland, and London. In addition to its robust financial services, Hong Kong offers a business-friendly environment with streamlined regulations, easy access to financing, and government incentives aimed at attracting more family offices, with a goal of reaching 600 more by 2025. 
Moreover, Hong Kong provides a high quality of life, with world-class education, healthcare, and a safe, vibrant lifestyle, making it an ideal location for families to both manage their wealth and enjoy a well-rounded living experience. 
### Key market trends
The family office sector in Hong Kong is shaped by several emerging trends. One notable trend is the increasing interest from ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) individuals and families in establishing family offices in the city, driven by Hong Kong's competitive tax regime and new initiatives like the **Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (CIES)**⟨70⟩. This scheme, along with tax concessions for

Global economic factors also play a crucial role in influencing the local family office market. Hong Kong's deep capital markets, global connectivity, and proximity to Mainland China make it an attractive location for family offices, especially as digital technology continues to break down geographical barriers. The city's flexibility, innovation in capital markets, and its strategic position in Asia further contribute to its appeal as a preferred location for family offices. 
## Supportive policies for family offices in Hong Kong
Hong Kong has long been a preferred location for both homegrown and foreign family offices, particularly those seeking access to Mainland China, due to its stable legal framework, favorable tax environment, and benign territorial tax system. Historically, capital gains and foreign-sourced dividends were not taxed under this system, and the overall tax rates remained relatively low. Additionally, the city's low personal income tax rates have made it an attractive destination for expatriate professionals. However, there has been some ambiguity in the past regarding what constitutes a taxable capital gain versus a non-taxable trade profit. 
In response to the growing success of similar tax exemption schemes in Singapore**,** Hong Kong recognized the **need to provide greater tax certainty⟨71⟩** for single family offices (SFOs). To address this, the Hong Kong government introduced the 
Under the new law, gains from the trading of most bankable assets, known as "qualifying transactions," are exempt from Hong Kong Profits Tax, provided certain conditions are met. These conditions include: 
  * The SFO must exclusively serve one family.
  * Both the SFO and the FIHV must be at least 95 percent beneficially owned by the family, although this threshold can be reduced to 75 percent if the remaining 25 percent is held by a tax-exempt charity under 
  * The SFO and the FIHV(s) must be managed and controlled in Hong Kong, although the vehicles themselves do not need to be incorporated in the city.
  * The assets under management must exceed HKD 240 million.
  * For each FIHV, the family office must employ at least two qualifying investment professionals (who can be family members) and maintain a minimum annual operating expenditure of HK$ 2 million (US$ 256,510.60).

Notably, because SFOs typically do not provide investment advice or asset management services to third parties, they are not required to obtain regulatory approval from the Securities & Futures Commission of Hong Kong (SFC). Moreover, there is no special application or registration process required to benefit from the FIHV tax exemption. 
These measures are part of a broader strategy by the Hong Kong government to attract more family offices and strengthen the city’s status as a leading asset management hub in Asia. To further this goal, 
## How to set up a family office in Hong Kong
Setting up a family office in Hong Kong involves a structured approach to ensure effective management of wealth and long-term preservation across generations. Below are the key formal steps and considerations:  **Key steps to set up a family office in Hong Kong**  
---  
**Steps** | **Details**  
Determining the type of family office | A decision is made between establishing a Single Family Office (SFO), which serves one family, or a Multi-Family Office (MFO), which caters to multiple families. An SFO offers more personalized and exclusive services, while MFOs provide shared resources among several families.  
Choosing the appropriate legal structure | An appropriate legal structure is selected for the family office, such as a limited company, partnership, or trust. A limited company is the most common choice due to its flexibility and limited liability protection.  
Preparing and submitting necessary documents | To register a family office in Hong Kong, you will need the following documents: 
  * Company registration form (Form NNC1)
  * Articles of association
  * Identification documents of directors and shareholders
  * Proof of registered address
  * Business plan (if applicable)

These documents are submitted to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, either physically or through the electronic service platform. The registration process typically takes 1-2 business days.  
Opening a bank account | Once the company registration is complete, the next step involves opening a bank account for the family office. This process typically takes 2-4 weeks, depending on the bank's due diligence procedures.  
Tax registration | The family office is registered for business and profits tax with the Hong Kong Inland Revenue Department. This step ensures compliance with Hong Kong tax laws and enables access to the favorable tax regime designed for family offices.  
Hiring full time employees | To benefit from tax incentives, the family office must hire at least two full-time employees and incur annual operating expenses of at least HKD 2 million. These employees typically include investment managers, legal advisors, and financial experts, ensuring the professional management of family assets.  
Establishing a family charter | A family charter is established to outline the family's long-term goals, values, and governance structure. This document serves as the strategic foundation for decision-making and ensures that the office operates in alignment with the family's objectives for wealth management and legacy building.  
Developing an asset management strategy | The types of assets to be managed by the office are defined, which may include real estate, financial instruments, or art collections. Structuring assets for tax efficiency, typically through private trusts, can optimize wealth growth and preservation.  
In addition to the essential steps outlined for establishing a family office in Hong Kong, ongoing compliance with local regulations and tax obligations is critical for sustained operations. It is advisable to regularly review the family office's investment strategies and governance structures to ensure they adapt to evolving market conditions and the family's changing needs. Engaging with a network of local experts, including legal and financial advisors, can help navigate the complexities of Hong Kong’s regulatory environment, ensuring optimal tax efficiency and compliance.

# Guide to Hiring Employees in Hong Kong 
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/human-resources-and-payroll/guide-to-hiring-employees-in-hong-kong)
Hiring employees in Hong Kong must comply with the region’s key labor legislations, especially the Employment Ordinance, which is the main piece of legislation governing conditions of employment and highlights employees’ rights and the duties and responsibilities of employers and employees.
  

Contributing Advisor
The Employment Act separates employees into two categories, which are:
  * Employees employed under a continuous employment contract (entitled to all the statutory benefits under the Employment Ordinance); and
  * Employees employed under an employment contract (entitled to essential protection under the Employment Ordinance).


An employee employed continuously by the same employer for four weeks or more, with at least 18 hours worked each week, is regarded as employed under a continuous contract.
Rights and Obligations of Employers and Employees  
---  
Employment contract |  Continuous employment contract  
Maximum work hours/week |  Per contract (Normally 40-50 hours) |  Per contract (Normally 40-50 hours)  
Maximum workdays/week |  Per contract (normally 5 days) |  Per contract (normally 5 days)  
Overtime |  Per contract |  Per contract  
Statutory holidays (paid) |  13 Days |  13 Days  
Annual leave (paid) |  Not applicable |  1st & 2nd Year: 7 days. 3rd Year: 8 days.  
4th Year: 9 days (maximum of 14 days)  
Sick leave (paid) |  Not applicable |  1st Year: 2 days/ completed month  
2nd Year: 4 days/ completed month (up to a maximum of 120 days)  
Maternity leave (paid) |  Not applicable |  14 weeks, subject to certain conditions.  
Year-end bonus |  Not applicable |  Per contract  
Medical insurance |  Per contract |  Per contract  
Mandatory provident fund (MPF) contribution |  Required |  Required  
Probation |  Per contract (normally 1-6 months) |  Per contract (normally 1-6 months)  
Long service payment |  Not applicable |  Minimum 5 years of work (subject to conditions)  
## Employers’ duties
Employers have specific obligations they need to fulfill, including creating the employment agreement, submitting the employer's Return, notifying tax authorities about the departure of non-resident employees from Hong Kong, and making contributions to the Mandatory Provident Fund. 
Creating the employment agreement:
The required information to be incorporated in the employment contract includes:
  * Job title
  * Duration of employment
  * Responsibilities of the employee
  * Commencement date of employment
  * Weekly working hours
  * Entitlements and benefits
  * Conditions for contract termination


### Preparing employee’s written contract
While employees' rights and benefits are protected under the Ordinance irrespective of whether the employment contract is made verbally or in writing, employers and employees are encouraged to enter written employment contracts, which remind both parties of their obligations and help avoid possible disputes.
Employers and employees are free to negotiate and agree on the terms and conditions of employment concerning a company's system of compensation and benefits if they do not violate the provisions of the Employment Ordinance (Cap. 57).
An employer must inform each employee of the conditions of employment under which they are to be employed before employment begins regarding:
  * Wages⟨36⟩ (including the rate of wages, overtime rate, and any allowance, whether calculated by the piece, job, hour, day, week, or otherwise);
  * Wage period;
  * Length of notice required to terminate the contract; and
  * If the employee is entitled to an end-of-year payment, the end-of-year payment or proportion and the payment period.


If the employment contract is in writing, the employer shall give one copy of the written contract to the employee for retention and reference.
Did You Know
In the case of unwritten contracts, the employer shall provide the employee with such information in writing if the employee makes a written request before such employment is entered.
An employer who fails to comply with the above requirements is liable to prosecution and, upon conviction, to a fine of **US$10,000**.
## Employment age
Hong Kong’s statutory minimum working age is 18. However, minors are permitted to work in specific settings depending on their age, subject to certain limitations.
  * Children must be at least 15 years old to work in an industrial setting and are subject to daily and weekly work-hour limits.
  * Children aged 13 and 14 can only work in non-industrial establishments if they attend full-time schooling and must complete Form III of secondary education.
  * Children under 13 are prohibited from taking up employment unless the Commissioner for Labor grants special permission. This condition may be done for art and training, allowing them to be employed as entertainers. This employment will be subject to certain restrictions the Commissioner for Labor sets.


## Hiring students
There are no restrictions to hiring students who are citizens or permanent residents of Hong Kong on a full-time or half-time basis.

Student employees are also entitled to Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) contributions, provided they are over 18 and are employed for 60 continuous days. This regulation can, therefore, also apply to seasonal or part-time student workers. 
Employers must contribute at least five percent of the employee’s monthly earnings, regardless of their salary. 
The minimum work age in Hong Kong is 18, and hiring students under this age is subject to certain limitations and requirements.
International students can take on certain types of employment during their studies, either during term time or summer breaks, namely: 
  * The internship is related to the student’s field of study and is endorsed by their university;
  * Part-time on-campus employment, up to 17 hours per week; and
  * Summer employment isn’t subject to any limitations on work hours or type of employment but can only be undertaken **between June 1 and August 31** each year.


There are no restrictions on the remuneration for local, permanent resident, or international students.
## Hiring part-time employees and contractual staff
Part-time or contract employees are not formally defined in the Employment Ordinance. However, part-time staff usually work fewer hours than full-time staff. Contract workers refer to workers who sign fixed-term labor contracts. Under Hong Kong's Employment Ordinance, part-time and contract employees enjoy the same protection as permanent full-time employees.
## Hiring foreign employees
To attract foreign professionals possessing unique skills, knowledge, or expertise not readily accessible in Hong Kong, the government welcomes their employment in the region. To legally work in Hong Kong, foreign nationals are required to hold a valid employment visa.
Individuals who meet the specified criteria may seek 
  * Maintain a clean criminal record.
  * Possess a solid educational background, typically holding a primary university degree in the relevant field of employment.
  * Demonstrate the existence of a genuine job opening.
  * Secure a confirmed employment offer.
  * Receive a compensation package in line with the prevailing market rates for professionals in Hong Kong.


The Immigration Department evaluates work visa applications based on the following conditions:
  * The applicant can substantiate their exceptional experience and qualifications for the position, which local Hong Kong residents need more time to fill.
  * The sponsoring company must provide supporting documents and explain why they cannot fill the job locally.
  * The company can commit to conducting business activities in Hong Kong.


The existing visa schemes for foreign employees in Hong Kong are outlined below:
Types of Visas for Foreign Employees  
---  
Employment visa |  Supplementary labor scheme visa  
Foreign professional staff who have graduated from an academic institute in Hong Kong, as well as foreign professional staff and mainland Chinese who have yet to graduate from Hong Kong but possess special skills, knowledge, or experience needed by Hong Kong. |  Semi-skilled professionals at technician level or below.  
Valid for 1 year initially (renewable) |  Valid for 1 year initially (not renewable)

## Hong Kong minimum wage 
Hong Kong has increased the minimum hourly wage rate from **HK$37.5 (US$4.8)** to **HK$40 (US$5.11)**.
Hong Kong employers must record the total number of hours worked by an employee in a wage period if: 
  * The employee is paid the minimum wage; and
  * The wages payable to the employee for the wage period are less than the monetary cap specified in the Ninth Schedule to the Employment Ordinance (or a proportionate amount if the wage period is less than a month).


According to the Ninth Schedule, the monetary cap has been increased from **HK$15,300 (US$1,957)** per month to **HK$16,300 (US$2,085)** per month.

# Closing a Business in Hong Kong 
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/company-establishment/changes-in-corporate-structure)
Closing a business is a significant decision. It involves a structured process known as winding up. There are various modes of winding up, and it's crucial to understand the steps, legal implications, and consequences involved.
  

Contributing Advisor
## Which types of businesses can undergo winding up procedures?
Only a limited company⟨11⟩ can undergo winding-up, similar to liquidation. This process involves selling the company's assets to repay its debts legally, ultimately leading to its closure.
A limited company is registered under the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622 of the Laws of Hong Kong). It's a distinct legal entity capable of legal actions and lawsuits.
Did You Know
Shareholders' liabilities are limited to the value of their held shares or, in rare cases, to an agreed contribution during winding-up.
There are three points business owners need to take into consideration:
  * An "unlimited company" doesn't fit the traditional company definition. Instead, it resembles a sole proprietorship or partnership.
  * A sole proprietorship⟨11⟩ is an individual-owned business, with the sole proprietor bearing full responsibility for its liabilities.
  * A partnership⟨11⟩ involves ownership by two or more partners, each personally and jointly liable for the business's liabilities.


## Directors’ duties
When a provisional liquidator is appointed or a winding-up order is issued, the authority of the company's directors ends. However, they remain obligated to fulfill specific responsibilities.
Failure to maintain accurate financial records and prepare a statement of financial affairs can lead to the Official Receiver's Office pursuing legal actions, including prosecutions and potential disqualification of the directors.
## Winding-up modes
A company in Hong Kong may wind up by:
  * The company can initiate **voluntary winding-up** in Hong Kong, regardless of its financial health. This process consists of two types:
  * **Members' (Shareholders') Voluntary Winding-up** : The company calls its shareholders to a general meeting and passes a special resolution for winding-up. An application to the Court may follow if needed.
  * **Creditors' Voluntary Winding-up** : Similar to members' voluntary winding-up, a meeting of creditors is also convened, and a liquidator may be nominated during this process.
  * The High Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region can order **compulsory winding-up** under certain circumstances:
  * The company is unable to pay a debt of HK$10,000 (US$1,200) or more.
  * The Court deems it just and equitable to wind up the company.
  * The company passes a special resolution for compulsory winding-up.


Creditors, shareholders, or the company itself can file a winding-up petition. Legal aid may be available for eligible applicants.
### Voluntary winding-up
#### Winding-up by the owners
A company can initiate a voluntary winding-up process by convening a general meeting of its shareholders if it’s proven to be solvent by meeting all of its financial obligations. If a special resolution is passed during this meeting, the company can apply to the Court for a winding-up order.
Alternatively, if a special resolution indicates the company's intent to wind up voluntarily, there is no need for a winding-up order from the Court.
The key steps involved in voluntary winding-up are as follows:
  * The shareholders must approve a special resolution for voluntary winding-up.
  * Within 14 days of passing the resolution, a notice of the resolution must be published in the Government Gazette.
  * The company is required to organize a creditors' meeting, and the notice for this meeting must be published in the Government Gazette and both Chinese and English newspapers.
  * The company's directors must provide a comprehensive statement on its financial status, including a list of creditors and their estimated claims, to be presented at the meeting. Resolutions to the winding-up process can be made during this meeting.
  * During this meeting, a liquidator may be nominated and appointed. Additionally, an inspection committee may oversee the liquidator's activities.
  * The appointed liquidator will manage the company's affairs and conduct regular meetings with the company and its creditors to report on the winding-up progress.
  * Once the company's affairs have been fully settled, the liquidator will compile a report on the winding-up process and convene a final meeting for the company and its creditors.


If a special resolution cannot be passed during a general shareholders' meeting, the board of directors can still pass a resolution for the company's dissolution. This resolution should include the following:
  * The company is unable to continue its operations due to its liabilities.
  * The directors believe it is necessary to wind up the company.
  * The impracticality of utilizing other provisions of the Companies (Winding-Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance for the winding-up process.
  * A meeting of the company and its creditors will occur 28 days after delivering a declaration to the Registrar of Companies.


A declaration detailing this resolution must be signed by a director and submitted to the Registrar of Companies within seven days of the resolution date. Meetings of the company and its creditors should be organized within 28 days of delivering this declaration. Additionally, the appointment of a provisional liquidator is required upon submission of the declaration.
Due to the complexity of the above procedures, the entity is advised to consult a lawyer or other qualified professionals before commencing such actions.
#### Voluntary winding-up effects
When the voluntary winding-up process begins, the company will halt all operations except those necessary to ensure a smooth winding-up. The legal status and powers of the company will continue until it is dissolved.
Furthermore, any transfer of shares (except a transfer made by the liquidator or made with the concerned party’s approval) and any alteration to the status of the company members made after the commencement of a voluntary winding-up will be void.
### Compulsory winding-up
A limited company may wind up by the Court in the circumstances set out in the Companies (Winding-Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance. The more common ones are:
  * The company is unable to pay a debt of HK$10,000 (US$1,200) or above;
  * The Court believes that it is just and equitable that the company should be wound up; or,
  * By special resolution, the company has resolved that the Court wind the company up.


A creditor, a shareholder, or the company itself can file a winding-up petition against the company. The petitioner typically instructs a solicitor to prepare and file the winding-up petition. Any person (e.g., employee) qualified to receive legal aid under the Legal Aid Ordinance and Rules may apply to the Legal Aid Department for assistance in filing a winding-up petition.
On the appointment of a provisional liquidator or the making of the winding-up order, the directors' powers of the company will cease. However, they still have certain duties to perform. If the directors fail to perform such duties, such as failure to keep proper books and records and failure to prepare a statement of affairs, the Official Receiver’s Office may take prosecution actions and disqualification actions against the directors.
#### Compulsory wind-up effects
In the context of court-ordered winding up, the process is set in motion when the petition is filed. Subsequently, once the winding-up has commenced:
  * Any action involving the company's assets, such as transferring shares or altering shareholder statuses, is prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Court.
  * The company or any creditor or shareholder can seek court intervention to halt or restrain proceedings.


Once a provisional liquidator is appointed or a winding-up order is issued against the company:
  * Legal action can only be pursued against the company with court approval.
  * The Official Receiver assumes the role of provisional liquidator unless a provisional liquidator has already been designated before issuing the winding-up order.
  * If the company's assets are expected to be at most HK$200,000 (US$25,500), the Official Receiver, provisional liquidator, can appoint another individual to take their place.
  * The provisional liquidator assumes control over the company, including its assets and financial records, while also inquiring into its operations.

## Company deregistration
A private company or a company limited by guarantee, other than those specified in section 749(2) of the Companies Ordinance, may apply for deregistration when it is defunct.
  * All shareholders agree to the deregistration;
  * The company has not yet commenced operations or business or has ceased operations or business during the three months before the application;
  * The company has no outstanding liabilities;
  * The company is not involved in any ongoing legal proceedings;
  * The company holds no assets consisting of any immovable property⟨25⟩ situated in Hong Kong, and
  * If the company is a holding company, its subsidiaries’ assets do not consist of immovable property in Hong Kong.


![company deregistration in Hong Kong⟨71⟩]
Before the company can be deregistered, it first needs to obtain a “Notice of No Objection to a Company being Deregistered” (“Notice of No Objection”) from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue Department (IRD), the Hong Kong tax office. Directors and shareholders, or a person authorized by the company, can apply for such a letter. To apply for this letter, the applicant has to fill in a form retrievable from the tax office website and pay a prescribed fee.

With the Notice of No Objection, the investor should apply for deregistration with the Companies Registry within three months. To apply for deregistration, the investor has to fill in the designated form and pay a fee. The Notice of No Objection needs to be included in the submission. Where the applicant is a company, it must designate a natural person to notify the Companies Registry.
The deregistration will then be published on the website of the Government Logistics Department. If no objections are made in the following three months – such as by alleged creditors – the Registrar may deregister the company by publishing another notice in the Gazette declaring it to be deregistered on the publication date of that other notice. Former directors must keep the books and papers of the company for six years after deregistration.
### What is the typical duration for the liquidation process of a company in Hong Kong?
Liquidating your company after deregistration can be a process that spans from 6 to 9 months, and in certain instances, it might extend to a full year.

# Guide to Employee Termination in Hong Kong
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/human-resources-and-payroll/guide-to-terminating-employees-in-hong-kong)
Employment termination follows specific regulations and practices that aim to protect both employers and employees. An employment contract can be terminated in two ways:
  

Contributing Advisor
  * Termination by notice or
  * Immediate termination.


## Immediate termination
The employer may terminate the contract without notice in case o
  * Willful disobedience of a lawful and reasonable order;
  * Misconduct;
  * Fraud or dishonesty; or
  * Habitual neglect of duties.


No notice is required during the first month of a probation period – if one is agreed upon. The employee may terminate the contract without notice for:
  * Reasonable fear of physical danger by violence or disease;
  * Ill-treatment by the employer; or
  * Becoming permanently unfit for the type of work engaged in, as judged by a medical practitioner.


## Termination by notice or payment in lieu of notice
### Notice period for resignation in Hong Kong
In Hong Kong, the notice period required for resignation is typically outlined in the employment contract. If not specified, the Employment Ordinance sets default periods depending on the duration of employment and whether the employee is under probation.
#### General guidelines
  * **During Probation Period:**
    * **First Month:** No notice is required by either party.
    * **After the First Month:** At least seven days’ notice is required unless otherwise agreed.
  * **After Probation:**
    * If the contract specifies a notice period, it cannot be shorter than seven days.
    * In the absence of a specified period, the default notice period is one month.


### Payment in Lieu of Notice
Employers and employees may mutually agree to a payment in lieu of notice. The calculation for the payment involves taking the employee's average daily wages⟨36⟩ or monthly wages (depending on whether the notice period is expressed in days, weeks, or months) earned in the 12 months preceding the day when the notice of termination is given, or the day when the contract is terminated if no notice has been given.

The employer or employee may terminate an employment contract by giving the other party due notice or payment in place of notice. In the case of a continuous contract of employment, the length of notice or the amount of payment in place of notice required are:
Table 1  
---  
Employment condition |  Length of notice |  Payment in lieu of notice  
During probation period |  Within the first month of probation |  Not required |  Not required  
After the first month of probation |  Where the contract makes provision for the required length of notice |  as per agreement, but not less than 7 days |  Table 2  
Where the contract does not make provision for the require d length of notice |  not less than 7 days |  Table 2  
For a continuous contract* with no/ after probation period |  Where the contract makes provision for the required length of notice |  as per agreement, but not less than 7 days |  Table 2  
Where the contract does not make provision for the required length of notice |  not less than 1 month |  Table 2  
* For a non-continuous contract with no/ after probation period, the length of notice shall be the agreed period; please refer to Table 2 for the corresponding payment in lieu of notice.  
Table 2  
---  
Notice period expressed in days or weeks.  
Average daily wages earned by an employee in the 12-month period preceding the day when a notice of termination of contract is given** |  X |  Number of days in the notice period for which wages would normally be payable to the employee |  = |  Payment in lieu of notice  
Notice period expressed in months  
Average monthly wages earned by an employee in the 12-month period preceding the day when a notice of termination of contract is given** |  X |  Number of months specified in the notice period |  = |  Payment in lieu of notice  
** In calculating the average daily/monthly wages, an employer has to exclude (i) the periods for which employees are not paid their wages or full wages, including rest days, statutory holidays, annual leave, sickness days, maternity leave, paternity leave, sick leave due to work injuries or leave taken with the agreement of the employer, and any normal working day on which the employer does not provide the employee with work; together with (ii) the sum paid to the employee for such periods.  
Employers should note that immediate or summary dismissal is a serious disciplinary action. It only applies to cases where an employee has committed serious misconduct or fails to improve after the employer's repeated warnings. An employer may only summarily dismiss an employee without notice or payment in place of notice if the employee, concerning their employment:
  * Deliberately disobeys a lawful and reasonable order;
  * Misconducts themselves;
  * Is guilty of fraud or dishonesty or
  * They are habitually neglectful in their duties.


## Termination prohibition
In five cases, an employee cannot be terminated:
  * An employee who is confirmed to be pregnant and has submitted a pregnancy notice;
  * An employee on paid sick leave;
  * For reasons of giving evidence or information related to court proceedings or an inquiry related to the enforcement of employment laws;
  * For trade union membership or activities; or
  * An employee injured at work without having first come to an agreement on compensation or before the issue of a certificate of assessment.


## Termination payments
The items and amount of payments payable to an employee on termination of employment or expiry of the contract depend on several factors, such as the length of service, the terms of the employment contract, and the reason for termination of a contract. Termination payments usually include:
  * Outstanding wages;
  * Wages in lieu of notice, if applicable;
  * Payment in lieu of untaken leave;
  * Any outstanding sum of end-of-year  payment, and pro rata end-of-year payment for the current payment period;
  * Where appropriate, severance payment or long service payment; and
  * Other payments under the employment contract, such as gratuity, provident fund, etc.


### Severance payment
An employee who has worked with a company for at least 24 months under a continuous contract is eligible for a severance payment. A severance payment is payable if the employee is dismissed because of redundancy, the contract is not renewed, or the employee is otherwise laid off.
Redundancy means that the employer closes or intends to close the business, has ceased or intends to cease to do business in that area, or the type of work the employee is involved in is expected to diminish or cease.
Layoff is a specific term that applies when the employee is hired under terms where remuneration depends on particular tasks that the employer provides. If during half of the total number of working days, in any consecutive four weeks, no work has been provided, this is a layoff. It is also a layoff if work has not been provided in one-third of any 26 consecutive weeks.
The severance payment should be calculated according to the following formula:
For monthly-paid employee |  For daily-rated/piece-rated employee  
---|---  
Severance payment |  2/3 of the last full month's wages* x accountable service years |  Any 18 days’ wages chosen by the employee out of their last 30 normal working days* x accountable service years  
*The sum should not exceed 2/3 of HK$22,500 (US$2,879) (i.e. HK$15,000) (US$1,919)  
Service of an incomplete year should be calculated on a pro-rata basis. Any gratuity or employer’s contribution and interests/dividends in Provident Fund (PF) / MPF Schemes can be set off from the total amount of Severance Payment.
The total entitlement is subject to a maximum payment of **HK$390,000 (US$49,908)**. Severance Payment shall be paid to the employee as soon as practicable and not later than two months after receiving a notice of claim made by the employee.
## Long service payment
Employees who have been employed under a continuous contract for not less than five years are entitled to long service payment if:
  * The employee is terminated for reasons other than serious misconduct or redundancy;
  * The contract expires and is not renewed*;
  * The employee dies (money goes to spouse, children, or parents);
  * The employee has been issued a certificate in a specified form by a registered medical practitioner or a registered Chinese medicine practitioner, certifying that the employee is permanently unfit for the present job and resigns; or
  * The employee is aged above 65 and resigns on grounds of old age.


The amount of any contractual gratuity based on length of service is deductible from the amount of extended service entitlement.
Did You Know
The amount of long service payment is calculated by reference to the same formula as for severance payment. The maximum entitlement shall be **HK$390,000 (US$49,908)**.
In addition, part of a retirement scheme payment, which is due to the employer’s contributions, may be deducted from the amount of long service payment. Long Service Payment shall also be paid by the employers to the employee as soon as possible but, in any case, not later than seven days after the day of termination.
What happens if I don’t serve the full notice period?
#### What happens if I don’t serve the full notice period?
If you do not serve the full notice period, you may be required to compensate your employer for the remaining period. This compensation is usually equivalent to the salary for the unserved portion of the notice period, depending on the terms of your contract or local employment laws.
Can my employer waive the notice period?
#### Can my employer waive the notice period?
Yes, your employer can waive the notice period. In such cases, they may allow you to leave immediately without requiring you to serve the full period. This decision is typically at the employer’s discretion and may involve a mutual agreement between both parties.
What is the impact of not providing notice?
#### What is the impact of not providing notice?
Failing to provide the required notice can result in financial penalties, such as forfeiting part of your final salary or being required to pay compensation to your employer. It can also harm your professional reputation, potentially affecting future job references.
Is the notice period the same for all types of employment contracts?
#### Is the notice period the same for all types of employment contracts?
No, the notice period can vary depending on the type of employment contract (e.g., permanent, temporary, or contract-based). It is usually specified in the employment contract, and different jurisdictions may have specific legal minimums for notice periods.
Can the notice period be extended or shortened by mutual agreement?
#### Can the notice period be extended or shortened by mutual agreement?
Yes, the notice period can be extended or shortened if both you and your employer mutually agree. Any changes to the notice period should be documented in writing to avoid disputes later.
What are my rights if my employer asks me to leave immediately after I resign?
#### What are my rights if my employer asks me to leave immediately after I resign?
If your employer asks you to leave immediately after you resign, they may be required to pay you for the notice period you would have served. This is called payment in lieu of notice, where the employer compensates you for the remainder of your notice period instead of requiring you to work it out.

## Entity types summary

# Setting Up a Business in Hong Kong
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/company-establishment)
Setting up a business in Hong Kong offers several advantages for investors⟨3⟩ - including its strategic location⟨6⟩, low taxes⟨23⟩, well-developed infrastructure, and strong legal framework. Whether you're an entrepreneur looking to expand your international presence⟨13⟩ or start a new business, this comprehensive guide will walk you through the process of establishing your business in Hong Kong.
  

Contributing Advisor
Selecting the most suitable approach for entering or expanding in the market demands careful deliberation of factors such as the intended investment scale, the nature of business activities, tax implications, and legal obligations.

This guide will explore the various choices for businesses seeking to enter the Hong Kong market. We will provide an overview of entity types, requirements, and procedures, highlighting key factors to ensure a company's successful establishment.
Additionally, we will offer guidance on the steps involved in opening a bank account, managing intellectual property rights (IPR), and the procedures for business closure should that become necessary.
### New arrangement for Business Registration Office public search service
The Business Registration Office now offers a convenient digital service called "Online Application for Business Registration Documents and Duplicate Business Registration Certificate" through the GovHK (
This transformation marks a significant shift from the conventional paper-based application process for public search services in Hong Kong. It empowers applicants to submit their requests using desktop computers or mobile devices at their convenience, regardless of location. This online approach ensures speed and efficiency and aligns with eco-friendly practices, reducing environmental impact.
Here's a list of the available documents for online business registration applications:
  * Electronic extract of information from the Business Register.
  * Certified extract of information from the Business Register.
  * A certified copy of a valid business/branch registration certificate.
  * Duplicate of a valid business/branch registration certificate.


You also can save and print the electronic records according to your specific needs once you successfully apply for an electronic extract of information from the business register or a duplicate of a valid business/branch registration certificate in a PDF format.
## Choosing a corporate structure
Hong Kong’s Companies Ordinance recognizes several types of companies⟨10⟩, including limited and unlimited companies with share capital.
The type of business entity that must be established will depend on the business plans. Whether the company is a profit or non-profit, as well as if it intends to raise capital via investment, will all factor into the decision when choosing the mode of setting up in Hong Kong.
Below we summarize the types of entities, their purpose as well as pros and cons:
3 Types of Enterprises Summary

### Offshore operations
A Hong Kong-based company can be legally formed without a physical presence, allowing for remote operations with no physical office or on-site staff.
Did You Know
If the company generates all of its income from sources outside Hong Kong, it will not be subject to taxation within the region.
Offshore companies⟨15⟩ offer enhanced flexibility and substantial cost savings, thanks to their more relaxed regulations and reduced operational expenses. Conversely, onshore companies enjoy heightened legitimacy in the eyes of Hong Kong authorities and seamless access to the local market. The choice between opting for an offshore or onshore company fundamentally hinges on a business owner's specific requirements and the objectives they aspire to accomplish.
 Also Read⟨10⟩ Comprehensive guide about Hong Kong company types.⟨10⟩
## Company set up process 
Once the appropriate corporate structure for your business is selected, the necessary registration and compliance procedures must be followed to set up the business⟨12⟩. It is advisable to consult with professional compliance and financial experts in Hong Kong to ensure that the chosen structure aligns with business goals and that all legal requirements are met. Additionally, staying informed about any regulatory changes is crucial for maintaining a successful business presence in Hong Kong.
### Selecting a company name
Before diving into the process of incorporating a company in Hong Kong, the first step is to secure approval for your chosen company name. This is a crucial initial requirement that must be satisfied before moving forward with your business registration.
### Registering an office address
To register a Hong Kong company, you must provide a local Hong Kong address as the registered address for the company. This address must be a physical location and cannot be a PO Box.
### Appointing key personnel
Selecting and appointing key personnel is pivotal in ensuring your business's growth and sustainability. We outline the key roles and considerations when appointing essential individuals in your Hong Kong business.
#### Company Directors
Directors are responsible for the overall management and decision-making within the company. They play a crucial role in setting strategic direction and overseeing daily operations.
Requirements: At least one individual director, no maximum limit. Directors can be of any nationality and do not need to be residents of Hong Kong. However, they must be at least 18 years old and have no history of ongoing orders of bankruptcy or malpractice.
#### Shareholders
Shareholders are the owners of the company. They hold shares in the business, which typically represent their ownership stake and financial interest in the company's success.
Requirements: A Hong Kong private limited company can have one shareholder or up to 50 shareholders. There are no residency restrictions for shareholders; they can be individuals or companies of any nationality.
#### Company Secretary
The company secretary is responsible for assisting the directors to ensure the company complies with all statutory requirements. They also handle various administrative duties.
Requirements: Appointing a company secretary is mandatory. If the secretary is an individual, they must ordinarily reside in Hong Kong. If it is a corporate entity, it must have its registered office or a place of business in Hong Kong.
#### Designated Representative (DR)
The DR is responsible for reporting concerning the Significant Controllers Register (SCR) to local authorities upon request. This role is particularly important after a regulatory amendment in 2018, which mandates creating and maintaining this register for most companies.
Requirements: It is mandatory to have a minimum of 1 designated representative. The position can be filled by either individual directors, Hong Kong’s local employees, professional bodies like lawyers, TCSP licensees, or auditors registered in Hong Kong.
### Minimum capital requirements
While there is no minimum capital requirement, businesses must specify share capital in the Articles of Association. Typically, for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and startups, companies set their authorized share capital at a nominal amount, such as HK$10,000 (US$1,200) or even as low as HK$1 (US$0.12)
While there isn't a specific mandated minimum, certain businesses might opt for a higher paid-up capital to enhance their credibility and financial resilience, especially when engaging with financial institutions, suppliers, or clients, considering this factor when evaluating the company's reliability.
### Obtaining a business registration certificate
A Business Registration Certificate (BRC) is an essential document issued by the Business Registration Office, and it plays a pivotal role in the operation of a company in Hong Kong. The certificate is obtained by completing form IRBR 37 and any other mandatory forms for different business entities.
Here are the key aspects of the BRC:
  * Purpose: The BRC is an official record of a company's essential details and is a mandatory requirement for conducting business in Hong Kong.
  * Application Requirement: Any business operating in Hong Kong is legally obliged to apply for a BRC within 30 days of commencing operations. Failure to do so can result in penalties.
  * Updates and Changes: If there are any alterations to the business's details, such as a change in address or nature of business, the Business Registration Office must be notified within 30 days. This ensures that the registry is kept up-to-date.
  * Information Displayed: A BRC contains crucial information, including the business name, nature of the business activities, registered business address, type of business, the date when business operations commenced, the certificate's expiry date, and a unique certificate number.


The Business Registration Certificate is a vital document that legally authorizes a company to operate and provides key information that helps regulatory authorities and the public identify and understand the nature of the business. Compliance with BRC requirements is essential for smooth and lawful business operations in the region.
A local private limited company needs to renew the business registration. The renewal can be done annually or once every three years, depending on whether the certificate is valid for one year or three years.
The Business Registration Office of the Inland Revenue Department will send a renewal demand note to registered businesses approximately in the middle of the month preceding the commencement month of the renewal Business Registration Certificate.

**How can I choose the right entry model for Hong Kong?**
#### **How can I choose the right entry model for Hong Kong?**
**Start With the Right Plan and Support.** As with any foreign country, Hong Kong’s setup requirements, options, and processes are unique, and establishing a legal entity requires the various costs of such an investment time and can bear other investment risks. Once investments are made, reversing strategies can be more challenging, so a company must avoid missteps from the outset.
A business' chance for success would do better with:
  * Well-defined business scope;
  * Informed and guided business model;
  * Selection of business partners or suppliers to work with;
  * Options for initial service lines, products, and pricing models; and
  * Options to set up in suitable locations and more.


Obtaining practical experience and insights in the market can significantly help in these areas and help position an enterprise for success in Hong Kong. Besides researching this Doing Business in Hong Kong guide thoroughly, it is advisable to leverage professional assistance for further guidance with pre-market entry, investment decisions, entity setup, and all business, operational, and financial factors that will arise along the path to achieving your investment objectives.

**How can I protect my intellectual property?**
#### **How can I protect my intellectual property?**
Recognizing the significance of safeguarding intellectual property rights, the Basic Law, which serves as the mini-constitution of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), explicitly outlines in **Articles 139** and **140** the SAR's responsibility to independently formulate effective policies and legal safeguards for intellectual property.
Considering this context, Hong Kong has formulated a comprehensive set of intellectual property laws. Therefore, Hong Kong ranked 16th according to the Intellectual Property Rights Index 2022. The country is also a major global IP trading hub.
Hong Kong recognizes several different classes of IP, including:
  * Trademarks;
  * Patents;
  * Designs;
  * Copyright;
  * Trade secrets;
  * Plant variations;
  * Domain names; and
  * Layout designs of integrated circuits.


IPR must be registered with the appropriate agencies and authorities to be enforceable in Hong Kong.

**How do I open a bank account?**
#### **How do I open a bank account?**
Opening a bank account in Hong Kong is often a vital first step to establishing a business presence. However, financial regulations in the SAR have been tightened to combat the city's designation as a tax haven.
Investors need help producing the required documents and conditions for maintaining fixed deposits. Many banks are expected to impose a monthly charge for failing to maintain a balance above a certain minimum amount.
Foreign investors need to understand the procedures and documents required. The internal practices of the bank may vary from one to another,

**How can I close a business in Hong Kong?**
#### **How can I close a business in Hong Kong?**
Closing a business is a significant decision, and in Hong Kong, it involves a structured process known as winding up. Company deregistration is also a common closing method employed by private and public companies limited by guarantee.
A company in Hong Kong may wind up by:
  * The company can initiate **voluntary winding-up** in Hong Kong, regardless of its financial health. This process consists of two types:
  * **Members' (Shareholders') Voluntary Winding-up** : The company calls its shareholders to a general meeting and passes a special resolution for winding-up. An application to the Court may follow if needed.
  * **Creditors' Voluntary Winding-up** : Similar to members' voluntary winding-up, a meeting of creditors is also convened, and a liquidator may be nominated during this process.
  * The High Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region can order **compulsory winding-up** under certain circumstances:
  * The company is unable to pay a debt of HK$10,000 (US$1,200) or more.
  * The Court deems it just and equitable to wind up the company.
  * The company passes a special resolution for compulsory winding-up.


Creditors, shareholders, or the company itself can file a winding-up petition. Legal aid may be available for eligible applicants.

# Hong Kong Company Registration: Private Limited Company Set-Up Guide 2025
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/company-establishment/requirements-and-steps-to-set-up-a-company-in-hong-kong)
For this guide, we only introduce the setup requirements and process of a private limited company in this chapter, as it is the most popular option for foreign investors.
  

Contributing Advisor
The process of Hong Kong company registration typically starts with selecting a unique company name and ends with the issue of a Certificate of Incorporation and business registration certificate. During the process, mainly two government departments are involved, namely the Companies Registry and Business Registration Office under the Inland Revenue Department.
## Step 1: Selecting a company name for registration
A company may be registered with an English name, a Chinese name, or an English and Chinese name. However, a company name with a combination of English words/letters and Chinese characters is not allowed. Investors can determine whether the desired name is already registered (or if a similar name is already registered) in the Companies Registry. Also, the name may not infringe upon other parties’ intellectual property rights⟨16⟩. It can be searched on the website of the Intellectual Property Department.
A limited company must include “Limited” at the end of its name unless a particular application is submitted for not having “limited” in the Companies Registry.
## Step 2: Key Considerations for Hong Kong Company Registration: Structure, Capital, and Office Address
After selecting a company name, the investor should decide the member of the board of directors of the intended company. The first shareholder (i.e., founder member) should obtain written consent from the director and, at the same time, obtain a copy of their passport or identification card and a copy of residential address proof from that person.
As part of the Hong Kong company registration process, the investor must decide on the amount of capital and the number of shares to be issued to the first shareholder(s). The Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622) does not restrict the minimum and maximum amounts of capital. It is the sole discretion of the investor to determine the amount of capital for the company based on the need of the operation and whether an extra license is required for the intended business activity. No par values are attached to these shares.

The Articles of Association (“Articles of Association”) should only state the number of shares and the amount of capital. The investor should contribute whatever amount stated in the Articles of Association immediately after registering the company.
All companies registered should appoint at least one natural person to act as its director. However, there are no restrictions on the nationality of the director.
The investor should also decide the company secretary, the designated representative of the significant controllers register, and the address of the registered office before registration. If there are two or more directors, one could act as company secretary. However, if the investor will be the sole director of the intended company, another person should be appointed to serve as company secretary. A written consent to act as company secretary should be obtained. The investor could also engage the service of a professional firm duly registered in Hong Kong to provide company secretarial service with a fixed annual fee.
The address of the registered office should be located in Hong Kong. There is no other particular limitation on the registered office address, but a postal box number cannot be used as the registered office⟨70⟩ address of a Hong Kong company.
If the founder does not plan to lease a physical office, they can also utilize the service of a professional firm. However, it should be ensured that the service provider must possess a Trust and Company Service Providers (TCSP) license.
## Step 3: Preparing registration documents and registering with the Companies Registry
The investor should prepare the registration documents, including mainly the Articles of Association, the incorporation form, and a Notice to Business Registration Office, and submit the documents mentioned above to the Companies Registry for registration. At the same time, the investor should pay the application fee for incorporation and the business registration fee and levy.
During the Hong Kong company registration, investors will need to pay an application fee for incorporation, which is HK$1720 (US$220), with a possible 10% reduction if done through the “e-Registry” portal. The business registration and levy fee are HK$2,200 (US$281) for a one-year certificate, and HK$5,870 (US$751.6) for a three-year certificate, in the period from 2024 to 31st of March, 2025. Investors can choose to register for one year or three years. If the documents are prepared in accordance with the prevailing laws and regulations, the Companies Registry will issue the Certificate of Incorporation together with the Business Registration Certificate, which signifies that the company legally exists.
### Requirements of acting as Company Secretary and Designated Representative
The secretary of a company may be:
  * An individual - must ordinarily reside in Hong Kong; or
  * A body corporate - must have its registered office or a place of business in Hong Kong.


A company’s designated representative must be either:
  * A director, employee, or member of the company who is a natural person resident in Hong Kong; or
  * An accounting professional, a legal professional, or a person who possesses a Trust or Company Service Provider (TCSP) license.


Generally, companies can be fully registered online if the founder members are individuals and the individual user accounts have been registered with the e-Registry, but investors can also file a paper company registration. Excluding the time needed to prepare the registration documents, the whole registration process will take one to five working days.
Note that some business activities may require additional permits, certificates, and approvals, the details of which can be checked on the 
## Step 4: Make the company chop and print the Articles of Association
After the company is officially incorporated, the investor should find a service provider to make the company chop and print the Articles of Association. Hong Kong has simplified the execution of documents by companies, and it is now optional for companies to keep and use the common seal, and the Articles of Association of the company can be in electronic form.
## What are the key compliance requirements for setting up a business in Hong Kong?
### Annual compliance requirements
A company is a separate legal entity; that is to say, it is a legal person and separate from its owners. The benefit of limited liability through operating as a limited company also brings obligations in so much as the company must comply with the various provisions in the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622).
These obligations include the timely disclosure and reporting of specified information about the company, its officers and shareholders, and the like. And any changes in such data to the Registrar of Companies so that members of the public can have ready access to the latest information of the company kept by the Registrar of Companies.
The annual compliance of a Hong Kong company includes:
  * Annual return filing*;
  * Business registration renewal;
  * Annual general meeting;
  * Auditor appointment;
  * Audited financial statements⟨32⟩ arrangements; and
  * Company structure changes⟨21⟩ update with Companies Registry.


### Compliance with the significant controller register
Under the Companies (Amendment) Ordinance 2018 (“the Amendment Ordinance”), all companies incorporated in Hong Kong (except listed companies) need to comply with the significant controllers register requirements.
Some of the critical requirements prescribed by the Amendment Ordinance include:
  * Identify and ascertain a person/ persons who has/have significant control over the company;
  * Maintain a significant controllers register to be accessible by law enforcement officers upon demand;
  * Designate at least one person as its representative to provide assistance relating to the company’s significant controllers registered to the law enforcement officers;
  * Keep the significant controllers registered at the company’s registered office or a prescribed place in Hong Kong; and
  * Keep the significant controllers register updated.


Failure to comply with the significant controllers register requirements in the Amendment Ordinance could qualify as a criminal offense.
Did You Know
The company and every responsible person in breach of the Amendment Ordinance could be liable for a fine levied at HK$25,000 (US$3,100) and, where applicable, a further daily fine.
A significant controller is a person or legal entity that meets one or more of the following conditions:
  * Holds, directly or indirectly, more than 25 percent of the company’s issued shares or a right to share more than 25 percent of the capital or profits of the company;
  * Holds, directly or indirectly, more than 25 percent of the voting rights of the company;
  * Holds, directly or indirectly, the right to appoint or remove the majority of the board of directors of the company;
  * Has the right to exercise, or exercises, significant influence or control over the company; or
  * Has the right to exercise, or exercise, significant influence or control over the activities of a trust or a firm that is not a legal person but whose trustees or members satisfy any of the above four conditions about the company.


To identify a significant controller, companies can review their register of members, articles of association, shareholders agreements, or other relevant agreements and issue notice(s) to any person who is believed to be the significant controller and any person who is supposed to know the identity of the substantial controller and obtain their required particulars.
Compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing requirements for trust or company service providers.
According to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance Ordinance (Cap. 615) (AMLO) issued by the Companies Registrar, a person that carries on a trust or provides company services is required to possess a TCSP license.
TCSP licensees are required to:
  * Take all reasonable measures to mitigate the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing; and
  * Ensure that, among other things, the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing requirements under the AMLO are complied with.


To fulfill the obligations mentioned above, TCSP licensees must assess the money laundering and terrorist financing risk of their businesses and develop and implement policies and procedures on:
  * Risk assessment;
  * Customer due diligence measures;
  * Ongoing monitoring of customers;
  * Suspicious transactions reporting;
  * Record keeping; and
  * Staff training.


Accordingly, companies must provide the due diligence documents to the service provider (TCSP licensee).
### Inspection regime
The inspection regime is implemented under the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622), which protects the personal information of directors and other relevant individuals who appear on the Companies Register.
Under the new inspection regime:
  * Correspondence addresses instead of usual residential addresses (URAs) of directors; and,
  * Partial identification numbers (IDNs) instead of full IDNs of directors, company secretaries, and other relevant persons like liquidators will be made available on the Companies Register for public inspection.


Meanwhile, companies can withhold the URAs and full IDNs (except the first part) on the registers where the information is maintained from public inspection. (The first part of the IDN is decided by an established rule, which is usually the first half of the sequence number if the IDN is an even number or the part that begins with the first character in the sequence and ends with the character that falls on the middle of the sequence if the IDN is an odd number.)
The URAs and full IDNs are regarded as “Protected Information” under the new inspection regime. Previously, the public could access the URAs and full IDNs of any company’s director, company secretaries, or other relevant persons.
By replacing URAs and full IDNs with correspondence addresses and partial IDNs, the protection of personal information will be enhanced. At the same time, it will ensure the transparency of the Companies Register by allowing the public to access it for the purposes stipulated under the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622).
Since substantial modifications are being made to the integrated Companies Registry Information System (“ICRIS”), the new inspection regime is being implemented in three phases:
#### Phase 1: August 23, 2021
Under phase 1, companies may replace URAs of directors with correspondence addresses and full IDNs of directors and company secretaries with their partial IDNs on their registers for public inspection.
#### Phase 2: October 24, 2022
Under phase 2, Protected Information on the Index of Directors on the Companies Register will be replaced with correspondence addresses and partial IDNs for public inspection. Documents containing Protected Information that are filed for registration – after the commencement of this phase, i.e., October 24, 2022 – will not be provided for public inspection, except for “specified persons” upon application.
#### Phase 3: December 27, 2023
Under phase 3, data subjects (i.e., individuals whose URA and full IDNs are contained in documents filed with the Companies Registry before the new inspection regime’s commencement) can apply to the Companies Registry to withhold their Protected Information contained in documents registered with the Companies Registry from public inspection and replace such information with their correspondence addresses and partial IDNs. Same as phase 2, only specified persons can apply to the Registry to access the Protected Information of directors and other persons.
To meet the requirements of this regime, and if data subjects and Hong Kong-registered companies want to withhold their Protected Information from public inspection, they should contact their service provider to update their personal information accordingly and make corresponding applications.

How do I open a company in Hong Kong?
#### How do I open a company in Hong Kong?
Opening a company in Hong Kong is a straightforward process that involves several key steps. Hong Kong is known for its business-friendly environment, low taxation, and strategic location, making it an attractive destination for entrepreneurs worldwide. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you establish your company in Hong Kong.
### 1. Choosing the type of company
The most common types of business entities in Hong Kong are:
  * **Private Limited Company** : A separate legal entity with limited liability. This is the most popular choice for foreign investors.
  * **Sole Proprietorship** : Owned by one individual who has unlimited liability.
  * **Partnership** : Owned by two or more individuals with shared liability.


**Note** : This guide focuses on setting up a Private Limited Company.
### 2. Selecting a company name
Ensure that your company name is unique and not already registered. You can check the availability on the Hong Kong Companies Registry's Cyber Search Centre. The name can be in English, Chinese, or both. Also avoid using prohibited words or expressions that require special approval.
### 3. Preparing the required documents
  * **Articles of Association** : Outlining the company's structure and operations.
  * **Incorporation Form (Form NNC1)** : Includes details like company name, registered address, share capital, and directors.
  * **Consent to Act as Director** : Each director must provide a written consent.


### 4. Appointing Directors and a Company Secretary
  * **Directors** : At least one director is required. They can be of any nationality and need not be residents of Hong Kong.
  * **Company Secretary** : Must be a Hong Kong resident or a company incorporated in Hong Kong. The secretary cannot be the sole director.


### 5. Registering the company
  * File the incorporation documents online via the 
  * Pay the registration fee and a business registration fee, which may vary depending on the company's share capital.


### 6. Obtaining a Business Registration Certificate
Upon incorporation, your company will automatically be registered with the Inland Revenue Department. After that, you will receive a Business Registration Certificate, which must be displayed at your business premises.
### 7. Setting up a registered office
Your company must have a registered office in Hong Kong. This cannot be a P.O. Box because official correspondence and legal notices will be sent to this address.
### 8. Opening a corporate bank account
  * Select a bank in Hong Kong⟨45⟩ that suits your business needs.
  * Prepare necessary documents like incorporation papers, Business Registration Certificate, and proof of business activities.
  * Banks⟨17⟩ may require a face-to-face meeting and have their own compliance procedures.


### 9. Complying with the ongoing requirements
  * File annual returns with the Companies Registry.
  * Maintain proper accounting records and have them audited annually by a certified public accountant in Hong Kong.
  * Submit Profits Tax Returns to the Inland Revenue Department.


Certain businesses may require additional licenses or permits (e.g., finance, food and beverage, import/export). Consult the Hong Kong Government's Business Licence Information Service for specific requirements.
Consider engaging a professional firm for assistance with incorporation and compliance, and protect your trademarks by registering them with the Intellectual Property Department.

### Code of Practice on Consumer Credit Data
Issued by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, this document provides guidance on the handling of consumer credit data, which is relevant in the context of KYC processes.
### Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations
While not specific to Hong Kong, the FATF's international standards and recommendations serve as a critical benchmark for the development of local AML and KYC regulations.
The following institutions are regulators in the financial landscape in Hong Kong:
  * Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) supervises banks and other financial institutions, ensuring that they comply with AML regulations. 
  * The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) enforces the regulations within the securities and investment industry. 
  * The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) formulates and implements policies on AML. 
  * The Insurance Authority, Customs and Excise Department, and Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) play a crucial role in investigating and combating money laundering and terrorism financing offenses in Hong Kong, collaborating with other regulatory bodies and intelligence agencies to address financial crimes.


To comply with the above regulations, investors need help producing the required documents and conditions for maintaining fixed deposits. Many banks are expected to impose a monthly charge for failing to maintain a balance above a certain minimum amount.
It is, therefore, important for foreign investors to understand the procedures and documents required. The internal practices of the bank may vary from one to another, but generally, the following procedures can be expected:
  * Most banks will require an initial appointment via phone, email, or physical visit;
  * Following this, a preliminary review is usually conducted by phone interview, electronic questionnaires, or physical meeting with directors, or by sending supporting documents to the bank manager;
  * If the preliminary review is passed, both parties will meet to sign the relevant bank application forms and documents, as well as pay the initial deposit and application fee: 
    * Deposit differs according to the bank and is subject to change occasionally.
    * Signatories also differ according to the bank and time. While some banks accept certified and actual copies of shareholders' IDs, others require the director/shareholder/ beneficial owner/ nominee to be physically present. In most cases, banks require the same number of people attending as that form quorum in a board meeting according to the Articles of Association to satisfy their Know Your Customer procedure.
  * At this stage, the bank manager will send the application for the department review, which typically takes one to two months. It is typical for the review department to require further supporting documents before finally opening a new bank account on your behalf.


The following documents are required during the application:
Document category |  Required documents  
---|---  
Company Documents |  Articles of Association  
Certificate of Incorporation  
Business Registration Certificate  
Statutory Documents (e.g., Form NNC1, Annual Return, Certificate of Incumbency)  
Organization chart  
Proof of Business |  Business plan  
Product catalogue  
Company / group website  
Memorandum of Understanding with potential clients  
Reference Letter from suppliers  
Bank Reference Letter  
Resume of Directors / Major Shareholders  
Proof of relevant experience (e.g., sales contract, delivery notes, shipping documents, purchase order from associated companies / previous business)  
Asset proof of investor (e.g., bank statements, Deed of Covenants)  
Personal Documents |  Passport  
Residency proof (e.g., utility bill, electricity bill, or bank statement issued within three months showing holder's address and name)  
Source of Funds |  Investor’s bank statements showing the source of funds for the investment in the Hong Kong company  
Due Diligence Documents |  Identity and address proof of:  
Shareholders (≥10%)  
Ultimate beneficial owners (≥10%)  
All directors  
All authorized signers  
Notes: _Banks might require further supporting information/documents during the review process._ _Banks have absolute discretion on the approval of bank accounts_  
When a company is labeled as a 'shell company,' it undergoes increased scrutiny. In this context, a shell company is defined as a corporation that doesn't engage in business activities but funnels funds for affiliated companies. It is essential to provide the identity documents of its beneficial owners to establish a bank account for a shell company.
Once the bank account has been approved, the investor will receive the bank account number, bank cards, and access codes.

## Opening a bank account online
As Hong Kong’s financial regulations follow strict anti-money laundering rules, opening a bank account online is impossible if it’s the applicant’s first one in Hong Kong.
However, once the applicant opens a bank account in Hong Kong and sets up online banking, they can open other accounts online.
Did You Know
Different banks have protocols and online bank account setup requirements. Businesses should select a suitable bank based on their needs and fee considerations. An online bank account set up for companies can be as fast as two working days.
In any case, businesses are advised to engage a professional service provider in Hong Kong to get everything done in advance, considering the complexity.
Advantages of virtual banks |  Disadvantages of virtual banks  
---|---  
  * Better rates and lower fees;
  * Integrations with enterprise software;
  * A high setup convenience; and
  * A heavy focus on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

| 
  * Include less personal relationship development;
  * Lack of ATM network;
  * Deposit inflexibility; and
  * Specific services unavailability.

  
## Money service operators
Another digital banking solution is money service operators. They usually offer services such as dedicated payment instructions, the ability to receive money via domestic or international bank transfers, and links to third-party services or currency exchange.
Virtual banks could offer a more convenient and cheaper service for foreign SMEs operating in Hong Kong. This condition is particularly true for business owners who operate subsidiaries in Hong Kong that primarily function as holding companies. However, the virtual banking industry is still growing and may not be reliable enough for companies.
## Opening offshore bank accounts for Hong Kong companies
Though most Hong Kong incorporated companies⟨70⟩ choose to open their bank accounts in the SAR, in theory, they are not mandated to own a corporate bank account in Hong Kong. Instead, they can register a bank account in other jurisdictions.
Hong Kong companies can open offshore bank accounts easily in most foreign countries. Each bank stipulates detailed protocols and requirements.
When it comes to bank account options for offshore companies in Hong Kong, companies have two primary choices:
  * **Open business bank account with local banks:** If you're an offshore company looking to establish a local bank account, be prepared for several steps. These include interviews with your company's directors and shareholders, thorough inquiries into your business activities, scrutiny of the sources of your funds, and discussions about your transaction volumes. It's advisable to seek the assistance of experienced corporate service providers or accounting firms.
  * **Open business bank account with offshore banks:** If you're an offshore company looking to establish an offshore bank account, be prepared for several steps. These include interviews with your company's directors and shareholders, thorough inquiries into your business activities, scrutiny of the sources of your funds, and discussions about your transaction volumes. It's advisable to seek the assistance of experienced corporate service providers or accounting firms. 
    * **Offshore bank considerations:**
      * **Security:** Offshore bank accounts do not have the same protection as accounts under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). Alternative security measures may safeguard certain offshore accounts;
      * **Taxes:** It's crucial to remember that you must report your income to the appropriate tax authorities and disclose any interest earned from offshore accounts;
      * **Costs:** Certain offshore accounts might incur a monthly fee or impose charges for international transactions, while others may not. Additional fees and expenses could also be applicable, so it's important to carefully review the terms and conditions before deciding to open an offshore account.


## International and national banking institutions
As one of the top international financial centers⟨3⟩, Hong Kong has one of the highest concentrations of banking institutions in the world, with over 70 of the largest 100 banks in the world having a presence and over 29 multinational banks having their regional headquarters in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong maintains a three-tier system of deposit-taking institutions comprising:
  * Licensed banks
  * Restricted license bank
  * Deposit-taking companies


They are classified according to the amount and term of deposits accepted and the nature of the business and are collectively known as authorized institutions. At the end of 2022, Hong Kong had 155 licensed banks, 15 restricted licensed banks, and 12 deposit-taking companies.

In addition to traditional banks, another emerging option is virtual banks, which have no physical branches and focus on digital services. This concept is still very new to Hong Kong, and the HKMA only granted eight licenses for virtual banking.

# Hong Kong Payroll and Human Resources
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/human-resources-and-payroll)
Hong Kong continues to attract businesses⟨3⟩ from around the world, and this dynamic city offers a wealth of opportunities for growth and prosperity. However, navigating the HR and Payroll landscape requires a deep understanding of its unique regulatory and cultural nuances.
  

Contributing Advisor
Understanding and navigating the intricacies of HR and Payroll in Hong Kong is essential for any business, whether it's an established corporation or a new entrant to this dynamic market. This comprehensive guide equips businesses with the knowledge and tools to ensure compliance, efficiency, and success in managing HR and Payroll in Hong Kong.
## Overview of Hong Kong Payroll and HR requirements
Employee onboarding |  Employers are obligated to provide information regarding the terms and conditions of employment. Includes details about wages, wage periods, termination notice periods, and year-end payment entitlements.  
---|---  
Visa and Legal Compliance |  Employers must ensure that employees are legally employable in Hong Kong. Employment cannot commence until the employee holds a valid visa or HKID status permitting work.  
Wage Management |  Employers are required to pay wages to employees promptly, no later than seven days after the end of the wage period. Failure to do so results in the employer paying interest on the outstanding wages to the employee.  
Statutory Paid Leave |  Employees enjoy various paid leave entitlements, including rest days, statutory holidays, paid annual leave, and paid sickness days. The number of statutory holidays and annual leave days varies based on employment duration, and paid sickness days can be accumulated.  
Maternity and Paternity Leave |  Female employees are entitled to 14 weeks of maternity leave, which must be paid. On the other hand, male employees can take five days of paternity leave for each spouse's confinement.  
Compliance and Record-Keeping |  Employers must maintain and submit various records and notifications to ensure compliance with employment regulations, including filing annual employer returns, notifying new hires, and reporting terminations as well as key employment details, such as the employee's name and HKID, employment contract, job title, wages, and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) contributions.  
Termination of employment |  Terminating an employment contract can be done for valid reasons such as employee conduct, qualifications, redundancy, statutory requirements, or other substantial reasons. Employers may also summarily dismiss employees for certain misconduct. Employees in Hong Kong enjoy legal protection against dismissal under specific circumstances, such as maternity protection, paid sick leave, participation in trade union activities, and injury at work.  
Severance and Long Service Payment |  Employees may be eligible for severance payment or long service payment based on specific conditions, including continuous employment and the reason for dismissal.  
## Labor laws
The Employment Ordinance is the main piece of legislation governing conditions of employment in Hong Kong. It covers a comprehensive range of employment protection and employee benefits, including.
  * Wage protection;
  * Rest days;
  * Statutory holidays;
  * Paid annual leave;
  * Sickness allowance;
  * Maternity protection;
  * Statutory paternity leave;
  * Severance payment;
  * Long service payment;
  * Employment protection;
  * Termination of employment contract; and,
  * Protection against anti-union discrimination.


With minimal exceptions, the Employment Ordinance applies to all employees in Hong Kong, whether domestic or foreign.
Other labor laws⟨19⟩ also play a key role in specific aspects governing the rights and responsibilities of employers and employees in the Special Administrative Region. These laws are:
  * Health ordinance: Hong Kong's labor law prioritizes workplace safety and health, emphasizing creating a hazard-free environment.
  * The Employees' Compensation Ordinance requires employers to compensate workers for work-related injuries or illnesses; and
  * Occupational Safety and Health regulations mandate preventive measures.

## Hiring employees
Hiring employees⟨20⟩ in Hong Kong must comply with the region’s key labor legislations, especially the Employment Ordinance, which is the main piece of legislation governing conditions of employment in Hong Kong. The Employment Ordinance highlights employees’ rights as well as the duties and responsibilities of employers and employees.
The Employment Act separates employees into two categories, which are:
  * Employees employed under a continuous employment contract (entitled to all the statutory benefits under the Employment Ordinance); and
  * Employees employed under an employment contract (entitled to essential protection under the Employment Ordinance).


An employee who has been employed continuously by the same employer for four weeks or more, with at least 18 hours worked each week, is regarded as being employed under a continuous contract.
Depending on the type of employment, employers have specific obligations they need to fulfill, including creating the employment agreement, submitting the employer's Return, notifying tax authorities about the departure of non-resident employees from Hong Kong, and making contributions to the Mandatory Provident Fund.

## Salary and wages
The Minimum Wage Ordinance of Hong Kong establishes a statutory minimum wage⟨36⟩ (SMW) regime aimed at striking an appropriate balance between forestalling inadequate wages and minimizing the loss of low-paid jobs while sustaining Hong Kong’s economic growth and competitiveness. SMW provides a wage floor to protect grassroots employees.
SMW is expressed as an hourly rate and ranges from **HK$37.5 (US$4.8)** to **HK$40 (US$5.11)**. Wages payable to an employee for any wage period should be no less than the SMW rate on average for the total number of hours worked.
Salary components include a base salary, typically paid monthly, and bonuses, often given at year-end. Bonuses can be contractual or discretionary, though they are customary rather than legally required, taking various forms like 13th or 14th-month salaries or double pay.
Allowances, such as traveling and attendance allowances, are considered part of wages as per the Employment Ordinance, but certain types, like contributions to retirement schemes and gratuity bonuses, are excluded. Overtime pay can be included in employment contracts as an allowance, even though it's not mandated by law.
Hong Kong does not withhold individual income tax (salaries tax) from employees' wages. Instead, employees are responsible for managing their own tax obligations.
Ensuring adherence to minimum wage regulations and maintaining accurate record-keeping is essential for employers in Hong Kong to remain compliant with labor and tax laws.

## Visa and employment permits
A visa or entry permit⟨34⟩ is required to work, study, establish, or join any business or to take up residence in the HKSAR. Otherwise, there is a high risk of being refused admission on arrival.
Hong Kong offers a visitor’s visa, which grants a visa-free period for citizens of most countries, usually for 7, 14, 30, or 90 days, depending on the country in question. For employment and investment, Hong Kong has several different types of visas for investment, including visas under the General Employment Policy (GEP), visas under the Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals (ASMTP), visas under Immigration Arrangements for Non-local Graduates (IANG), visas under Admission Scheme for the Second Generation of Chinese Hong Kong Permanent Residents, and visas under Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (CIES).
The existing visa schemes for foreign employees in Hong Kong are outlined below:
Types of Visas for Foreign Employees  
---  
Employment visa |  Supplementary labor scheme visa  
Foreign professional staff who have graduated from an academic institute in Hong Kong, as well as foreign professional staff and mainland Chinese who have yet to graduate from Hong Kong but possess special skills, knowledge, or experience needed by Hong Kong. |  Semi-skilled professionals at technician level or below.  
Valid for 1 year initially (renewable) |  Valid for 1 year initially (not renewable)  
However, no visa or entry permit shall be required if an individual holds certain travel documents such as Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Passport or British National (Overseas) Passport, etc.

## Terminating employees
The Employment Ordinances (EO) (Cap.57) govern employment law in Hong Kong, allowing both the employer and the employee to terminate a contract⟨23⟩ of employment. The party terminating the contract must provide the other party with a reasonable notice period or payment in lieu of notice, among other requirements.
Although dismissing employees in Hong Kong is easier than in other jurisdictions such as mainland China, the United Kingdom, or the United States, employers must follow all applicable statutory requirements as well as any special contractual stipulations. They should also be aware of the implied requirement of mutual trust and confidence wherever possible to not jeopardize the parties' relationship.
 Also Read⟨23⟩ Our Guide to Terminating Employees in Hong Kong.⟨23⟩
## Salaries tax
Income tax⟨30⟩ rates range from two percent to a maximum of 17 percent after deductions and allowances or 15 percent on net income after deductions. 
All individuals earning income arising in or derived from Hong Kong from an office, employment, or pension are subject to salaries tax in Hong Kong. Tax payable is calculated at a progressive rate on the “net chargeable income” or at a standard rate on the “net income” (before deduction of the allowances), depending on which is lower. It is further reduced by the tax reduction, subject to a maximum.
Tax Rates  
---  
Progressive rates (Year of Assessment 2018/19 onwards)  
Net chargeable income (HK$) |  Rate |  Tax (HK$)  
On the first 50,000 |  2% |  1000  
On the next 50,000 |  6% |  3,000  
On the next 50,000 |  10% |  5,000  
On the next 50,000 |  14% |  7,000  
Remainder |  17%  
Standard rate of tax (year of assessment 2014/15 onwards) |  15%

## Annual leaves and statutory holidays
Employees enjoy various paid leave entitlements⟨35⟩, including rest days, statutory holidays, paid annual leave, and paid sickness days. The number of statutory holidays and annual leave days varies based on employment duration, and paid sickness days can be accumulated.
Further, Hong Kong has some Western holidays in addition to holidays that match most of China’s official holidays. It currently has 13 statutory holidays (also called labor or factory holidays) and 17 public holidays (also called bank holidays). However, starting in 2024, the number of statutory holidays will gradually increase to 17 by 2030 (one additional holiday to be added every two years).
Further, employees are entitled to various forms of leave:
  * Annual Leave: Employees become eligible for paid annual leave after completing 12 months of continuous employment. The duration of paid leave gradually increases from seven days to a maximum of 14 days based on an employee's years of service.
  * Sick Leave: To take paid sick leave, employees must meet specific conditions, including a minimum of four consecutive days of sickness (with exceptions) and a medical certificate supporting the sick leave. Paid sickness days accrue at a rate of two days per month during the first 12 months of employment and four days per month after, up to a maximum of 120 days.
  * Maternity Leave: Maternity leave entitles pregnant employees to a continuous 14-week leave period, with added leave if childbirth is delayed. Maternity leave pay is calculated at four-fifths of an employee's average daily wages over the past 12 months, subject to a cap. Employers can apply for government reimbursement of maternity leave pay beyond the 10th week.
  * Paternity Leave: Male employees can take five days of paternity leave for each childbirth of their spouse/partner. Paternity leave pay is also calculated at four-fifths of an employee's average daily wages over the past 12 months, with a cap.

## Social Insurance
The Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) is a retirement scheme⟨37⟩ available in Hong Kong. This scheme covers all employees aged over 18 and under 65 with exemptions. An employer must comply with all MPF-related legal obligations under the law. These include enrolling all qualifying employees in MPF schemes and making MPF contributions for them.
Mandatory Contributions Payable by Employer and Employee by Monthly Relevant Income  
---  
Monthly relevant income |  Amount of mandatory contributions payable by employer |  Amount of mandatory contributions payable by employee  
Less than HK$7,100 |  Relevant income x 5% |  No contributions required  
HK$7,100 to HK$30,000 |  Relevant income x 5% |  Relevant income x 5%  
More than HK$30,000 |  HK$1,500 (US$191.91) |  HK$1,500 (US$191.91)  
Employee’s portion of mandatory MPF is deductible for calculating Hong Kong salaries tax, subject to a capped amount of **HK$18,000 (US$2,300)**. 
Social security is a vital part of employment in Hong Kong. Employees must contribute at least five percent of their monthly earnings, with options for extra contributions; mandatory contributions to recognized retirement schemes are tax-deductible up to HK$18,000 yearly.
For foreign investors, knowing these obligations is critical. Hong Kong workers enjoy medical coverage, including dental care and appliances. Employers cover treatment costs up to HK$200/day (US$25.6) (in-patient or outpatient) or HK$280 (US$35.8) for both in a day. The limit for medical appliances is HK$33,000 (US$4,222), increasing to HK$100,000 (US$12,794) for renewals.
Upon retirement, employees receive old-age pensions or lump sums based on contributions. Disability benefits range from HK$1,170 (US$149.7) to HK$2,340 (US$299.4) monthly, with lump-sum options. Survivor benefits are lump sums, too, combining contributions and interest. Social security also covers burial grants, up to HK$10,750 (US$1,375) for funeral costs. Understanding these details is vital for entering the Hong Kong market smoothly.

# Types of Company in Hong Kong
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/company-establishment/types-of-company)
Foreign investors can carry on business in Hong Kong through multiple business vehicles⟨11⟩, including:
  

Contributing Advisor
  * A company incorporated in Hong Kong;
  * A branch office of the foreign corporation;
  * A representative office;
  * Sole proprietorship; and
  * Partnership.


While some options are more commonly adopted than others, investors are advised to choose the most appropriate business structure based on the pros and cons of each option.
## Hong Kong companies
Foreign investors can establish their presence in Hong Kong by setting up a Hong Kong company. Companies incorporated in Hong Kong can be limited or unlimited and can be public or private. Described below are five types of companies that may be formed under the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 622):
![Hong Kong company types mapping⟨70⟩]
  * Private companies limited by shares (private limited company);
  * Public companies limited by shares (public limited company);
  * Companies limited by guarantee without a share capital;
  * Private unlimited companies with a share capital (private unlimited company); and
  * Public unlimited companies with a share capital (public unlimited company).


### Private limited company (Private companies limited by shares)
A company limited by shares has a share capital. The shares are issued to shareholders, and the liability of its shareholders will be limited to the unpaid subscription price for the shares. This is most suitable for a company that carries on a business for profit-making purposes.
A private limited company⟨12⟩ is a company limited by shares which:
  * Restricts the ability of its members to transfer shares;
  * Limits the number of members to 50 (not including employees or former employees); and,
  * Do not issue invitations to the public to subscribe for shares or debentures of the company.


Did You Know
Private limited companies are the most common type of business entity, accounting for 99 percent of all companies incorporated in Hong Kong.
Most small to medium-sized companies are set up as private limited companies due to their many advantages, such as their separate legal entity, limited liability to members, positive image among banks and investors, and the convenience of ownership transfer.
#### Minimum capital requirements
No minimum share capital requirement
#### Setting up timeline
Within one week
#### Key positions
A company secretary, a director, a maximum of 50 shareholders, and a designated representative are required.

### Public limited company
A public limited company is a company whose shares and debentures are offered to the public.
It is a public limited company if it is a limited liability company but does not fall into the scope of a private limited company or a company limited by guarantee.
Many public companies are listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited, and the statutory requirement for a public company is much stricter as it raises capital from the public. A medium to large private limited company may decide to transfer the company structure to a public limited company (thereby expanding its share base) – when they achieve significant growth in the industry.
#### Minimum capital requirements
No minimum share capital requirement
#### Setting up timeline
One hour to two working days for private companies incorporated online and four working days for offline companies incorporation
#### Key positions
  * A board of directors consisting of two members minimum;
  * A designated representative;
  * A company secretary and;
  * A minimum of one shareholder.


### Private limited company (Private companies limited by guarantee without a share capital)
A company limited by guarantee does not have share capital, but the liability of its members is determined by the amount of assets they contribute. This type of company is most suitable for nonprofit activities, such as operating a nonprofit research institute. It is not an appropriate structure for a business undertaken for profit-making purposes.
#### Incorporation fees
The Companies Registry charges an incorporation fee based on the number of members in the company. The price is HK$170 (US$21) for companies with 25 members or fewer, HK$340 (US$43) for those with more than 25 members but not exceeding 100, and an additional HK$20 (US$2.5) for every 50 members or less after the first 100 members.
It is worth noting that if the company is exempt from profits tax⟨24⟩ under section 88 of the Inland Revenue Ordinance, the business registration fee with the IRD is not applicable.
#### Setting up timeline
4-6 weeks to 6 months or more depending on business activity.
#### Key positions
  * One member, two individual directors, and one corporate secretary are required.
  * The member may be an individual or a corporation, with no nationality restrictions.
  * The company secretary can be a Hong Kong resident or a corporate entity registered in Hong Kong.
  * A designated representative who is a Hong Kong resident or qualified professional firm must be appointed.
  * Each member must declare the guaranteed amount.


### Other requirements
  * The registered office address must be located within Hong Kong.
  * Annual audited financial statements must be submitted to the Companies Registry, which is accessible to the public.
  * Profit distribution is prohibited.
  * Articles of association are mandatory.


### Ongoing obligations
A series of ongoing responsibilities outlined in the Companies Ordinance encompass:
  * Maintaining comprehensive records of debenture holders, members, directors, and company secretaries.
  * Ensuring the upkeep of accurate accounting books, subject to annual audits.
  * Organizing annual general meetings as required.
  * Submitting annual returns to the Companies Registry and remitting the annual registration fee to the Inland Revenue Department for the Company's Business Registration renewal unless the company qualifies for exemption from profits tax under Section 88 of the Inland Revenue Ordinance.
  * Preparing audited financial statements to present during the annual general meetings.
  * Renewing the business registration annually or once every three years, depending on whether the certificate is valid for one year or three years.
  * Filing annual tax return with the Inland Revenue Department including financial statements and tax computations one month from the date of issue.


### Unlimited company
The essential difference between a limited and unlimited company lies in the absence of any ceiling on the amount of capital an individual can inject into an unlimited company. Investors are responsible for infusing funds into the company whenever necessary, and the sole method to prevent its financial downfall is the owners' continual investments.
Members of an unlimited company are not restricted in terms of their financial liabilities, similar to partnerships. However, unlike a partnership, an unlimited company is recognized as a distinct legal entity. Due to this resemblance, many startup businesses establish themselves as partnerships to avoid the complexities of registering and incorporating a company.
## Branch offices
A branch office in Hong Kong lacks a distinct legal identity and is considered an extension of its overseas parent company. Consequently, the overseas parent company assumes full responsibility for all the debts and obligations incurred by the branch office.

A foreign corporation wishing to establish a Hong Kong branch office must register with the Companies Registry as a non-Hong Kong company and obtain a Business Registration Certificate.
Branch offices of foreign companies registered in Hong Kong are subject to the exact legal and tax requirements and ramifications as locally incorporated companies. The allowable business activities in Hong Kong and the applicable profit tax rate remain identical for foreign company branch offices and locally registered companies.
Although this option is generally not recommended due to the parent company's increased liability for branch offices, foreign investors may still favor this approach over establishing a subsidiary due to specific considerations:
  * A branch office might be more tax efficient for the parent company under certain circumstances, such as when losses incur in the Hong Kong branch.
  * Generally, the transfer of the shares of a foreign company operating a branch in Hong Kong is not subject to stamp duty.
  * A branch office is subject to limited compliance requirements under the Companies Ordinance.
  * A branch office is not required to conduct a separate audit.
  * A branch office can be terminated quickly by notifying the Company Registry.


#### Setting up timeline
12-14 working days
#### Minimum capital requirement
No minimum share capital requirement
## Representative offices
Like a branch office, a representative office lacks a distinct legal identity. Instead, the parent overseas company assumes full responsibility for any debts and obligations incurred. However, it's important to note that a representative office is prohibited from engaging in profit-generating business activities; otherwise, it must undergo registration as a branch office. Its functions are limited to promotional efforts, communication, and market research.
While representative offices do not require registration with the Companies Registry, they must apply for a Business Registration Certificate through the Inland Revenue Department.
Compared to branches, representative offices may be preferable for foreign investors interested in exploring the Hong Kong market. This preference arises because representative offices are exempt from submitting profit tax returns in Hong Kong if they do not conduct profit-generating activities within the region.
#### Setting up timeline
2-3 working days
#### Minimum capital requirement
No minimum share capital requirement
## Sole proprietorship
A sole proprietorship is the most straightforward and uncomplicated business structure, wholly owned and managed by a single individual. It lacks a distinct legal identity, with the sole proprietor entitled to all business profits while personally shouldering all liabilities. The sole requirement for establishing a sole proprietorship is obtaining a Business Registration Certificate.
Beyond its simplicity in setup, a sole proprietorship offers specific tax advantages. The sole proprietor can opt for "Personal Assessment" when filing their tax return for the year. This approach subjects the sole proprietorship's profits to the salary tax scheme, which benefits from generous allowances, deductions, and a potentially lower progressive tax rate than corporate taxation. Additionally, any business losses incurred within the sole proprietorship can be offset against the proprietor's other sources of income.
Conversely, a sole proprietorship is regarded as the riskiest business form due to the sole proprietor's joint liability for the business's debts. Personal assets are not shielded from these liabilities. Consequently, sole proprietorship is generally not recommended for investors.
#### Setting up timeline
1-2 working days
#### Minimum capital requirement
No minimum share capital requirement
## Partnership
A partnership is a business arrangement in which two or more individuals collaborate to share profits.
Hong Kong recognizes two primary types of partnerships:
### General partnerships
In a general partnership, partners possess complete property rights and bear personal liability for the debts and obligations incurred by the partnership. The primary procedural requirement for establishing a general partnership is obtaining a Business Registration Certificate.
### Limited partnerships
In a limited partnership, at least one general partner must manage the partnership and assume total debt liability. Additionally, there can be one or more limited partners whose liability is limited to the capital they contribute to the partnership. Limited partners need the authority to manage or oversee the partnership's operations. Registering a limited partnership with the Companies Registry and obtaining a Business Registration Certificate is mandatory.
Partnerships offer distinct advantages over companies as they are generally easier to establish, maintain, and dissolve. They are subject to fewer regulatory compliance requirements. Moreover, partnerships can be highly effective at attracting talented employees, as individuals with valuable skills, knowledge, and expertise may have opportunities for advancement to become partners themselves.
#### Setting up timeline
  * A limited partnership usually takes up to five working days to obtain a business registration.
  * A general partnership usually requires one to two working days to obtain the business registration.


#### Minimum capital requirement
No minimum share capital requirement
## Restrictions on foreign investment
Hong Kong does not subject foreign investments to special regulatory regimes or requirements per se. However, based on public interest, there are restrictions on voting control by non-Hong Kong residents and corporations in the broadcasting sector. Such restrictions are set out in the Broadcasting Ordinance (Cap. 562) and the Telecommunications Ordinance (Cap. 106). The government’s special industrial-land policy features somewhat more complex rules, but it is still less demanding than the policies of many other Asian investment centers.
### Television
The Broadcasting Ordinance states that foreign ownership of a Hong Kong company with a license to broadcast domestic free television requires written consent from the Broadcasting Authority at three thresholds:
  * Shareholding of 5-10 percent;
  * Shareholding of 10-15 percent; or
  * Shareholding of over 15 percent.


In addition, if foreign entities, in the aggregate, hold over 49 percent of voting control in such a company, their votes shall be subject to a formula as outlined in the Broadcasting Ordinance.
Did You Know
Companies with a license to broadcast domestic free television must be Hong Kong companies and may not be subsidiaries of another company.
These restrictions do not apply to paid television or non-domestic television.
### Radio
Foreign ownership in a company holding a sound broadcasting license must be at most 49 percent. Proper broadcasting licenses are exclusively available to Hong Kong-based firms, which cannot operate as subsidiaries of other companies.

# Intellectual Property Protection in Hong Kong
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/company-establishment/intellectual-property-protection)
## Intellectual property protection importance
Protecting intellectual property rights is essential for nurturing creativity. Hong Kong stands as a hub of creativity. Its global recognition in film production, television, sound recordings, publications, fashion, jewelry design, and graphic design highlights its prowess in these fields, drawing a substantial international audience.
  

Contributing Advisor
As an integral part of the global trading landscape⟨6⟩, it becomes imperative for Hong Kong to extend robust intellectual property rights protection to investors. By doing so, Hong Kong can ensure a level playing field that is equitable and conducive to conducting business⟨10⟩ freely.
## Basic Law and intellectual property rights
The Basic Law, which serves as the mini-constitution of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), explicitly outlines in **Articles 139** and **140** the SAR's responsibility to independently formulate effective policies and legal safeguards for intellectual property.
Did You Know
Considering the previous context, Hong Kong has formulated a comprehensive set of intellectual property laws. Therefore, Hong Kong ranked 16th according to the Intellectual Property Rights Index 2022. The country is also a major global IP trading hub.
Hong Kong recognizes several different classes of IP, including:
  * Trademarks⟨70⟩;
  * Patents;
  * Designs;
  * Copyright;
  * Trade secrets;
  * Plant variations;
  * Domain names; and
  * Layout designs of integrated circuits.


Below, we summarize the trademark⟨71⟩, patent⟨72⟩, design⟨73⟩, and copyright⟨74⟩ registration procedures. 
## Registering a trademark
For the benefits of a registered trademark, an application for registration must be made to the Trademarks Registry, Intellectual Property Department (IPD).
If you wish to register a trademark in Hong Kong, your first step is to check whether the trademark is already registered. This verification can be done online through the Trademark Online Search System. 
Once you confirm the trademark is available, you can proceed with the application process.
 Also Read⟨70⟩ Find out more about Trademark Registration in Hong Kong here.⟨70⟩
### Application process
This process can be done online via the IPD Electronic Filing Services or submitted physically to the Trade Marks Registry by completing Form T2, which should include a graphical representation of the trademark.
The Trade Mark Registry will carefully review it to ensure it aligns with the criteria specified in the Trade Marks Ordinance (Cap. 559) and the Trade Mark Rules (Cap. 559A). These criteria include:
  * The trademark must possess distinctiveness.
  * It cannot serve as a direct description of the goods or services the applicant is providing or intends to provide.
  * The trademark should not consist of industry-specific or business-related terminology.
  * It must not have been previously registered or applied for by another trader.


It's important to note that trademark registration exclusively covers the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) jurisdiction. Registering a trademark in Hong Kong does not confer any rights or protections in the Chinese Mainland, and vice versa.
### Registration timeline
Assuming your application is complete and accurate, the trademark registration process typically takes six months. Once approved, it will be published in the Hong Kong Intellectual Property Journal for public notice.
However, if your registration application is rejected by the Intellectual Property Department (IPD), they will promptly notify you in writing. You will then have a six-month window to rectify any issues with your application, with the possibility of a three-month extension if needed.
## Registering a patent
Patents protect inventors by giving them the legal right to prevent others from manufacturing, using, selling, or importing their patented invention. Patent owners can bring civil proceedings against infringement of their patent.
Patent protection is limited to the specific jurisdiction where it’s granted. Applicants must submit a patent application under the Patents Ordinance (Chapter 154) and the Patents (General) Rules (Chapter 514C) to protect their inventions in Hong Kong.
Therefore, some considerations come into play when you apply for a patent:
  * Basic patent law and principles for a better understanding of patent definitions and whether your inventions are available for patent registration;
  * Prior patent research to ensure that your inventions are new and meet the requirements;
  * Thoroughly assess the SWOT of your patent application procedures and IP protection strategy;
  * Patent specification containing patent’s description, illustration, and claims statements.


Hong Kong has three types of patents that fall into two categories:
  * Standard (O and R); and,
  * Short-term.

Standard patent (O) |  Standard patent (R) |  Short-term patent  
---|---|---  
Protection target |  Inventions with longer exploitation/commercialization terms |  Simple inventions with shorter exploitation/commercialization terms  
Maximum protection term (subject to renewal fee payment) |  20 years |  8 years  
General patentability requirement |  New, inventive, and industrially applicable  
Claim limitation per patent application |  Unlimited |  2 independent claims max.  
Pre-application requirement |  N/A |  Filing a patent application for the same invention with a patent office outside of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)*. |  N/A  
Support documents formality examination |  Mandatory for patent grant  
Thoroughly examining patent eligibility for applied inventions |  Mandatory for patent grant | 
  * Not required
  * A patent grant depends on the designated patent office granting the corresponding patent.

| 
  * Not required for patent grant
  * The patent owner or a third party may request a post-grant substantive examination to be conducted

  
* _The China National Intellectual Property Administration, the European Patent Office (in respect of a patent designating the United Kingdom), or the United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office._

## Registering a design
According to the Registered Designs Ordinance (Cap.522) and the Registered Designs Rules (Cap. 522A), registering a design is essential to obtain exclusive rights over the design within Hong Kong. Protection in other regions or with international agencies does not automatically extend to Hong Kong. Only the design’s rightful owner, whether through commission, employment contract⟨18⟩, or assignment, can apply for registration. This legal protection empowers creators to defend their innovative visual creations and rights.

A registered design is a legal safeguard for the unique visual characteristics of a product, such as its shape, pattern, or ornamentation, acquired through industrial processes. It exclusively focuses on the product’s appearance, irrespective of its functionality. This protection grants the owner the authority to prohibit others from manufacturing, importing, selling, or using products with the same design, and it can be renewed for up to 25 years in five-year increments.
For a design to be eligible for registration, it must be entirely novel at the time of application and should not have been previously registered or publicly disclosed. The registration process primarily involves a formal examination with a limited novelty or aesthetic appeal assessment. Excluded from registration are designs that do not significantly impact an article's appearance, those conflicting with public order or morality, computer programs, and designs solely driven by functional features.
### Application process
In summary, representations and a statement of novelty are crucial for clearly defining and protecting the features of a new design, ensuring transparency for the public.
For textile designs, a sample can be submitted under specific conditions. Design owners can claim convention priority if they apply within six months of their first application in a Paris Convention country or WTO member, provided the design is new at the priority date.
Confidential disclosures, such as those in confidence or during official international exhibitions, won't compromise the novelty of a design. Furthermore, designs displayed at or published after such exhibitions can maintain their originality if an application is submitted within six months of the exhibition's opening.
For updates on official international exhibitions, the 
Mentioned below are the application processes applicants must follow:
  * Application filing date examination and determination;
  * Formal requirements review;
  * Registration and publication.


To file for a design registration, submit the prescribed form, provide a representation and statement of novelty, and pay the registration fee. If the application is in order, the Designs Registry of IPD will publish the registration in the Hong Kong Intellectual Property Journal.
One application can include multiple designs if they relate to the same product group or category in the 
A “set of articles” refers to two or more items with a similar design and intended to be used or sold together.
It is advisable to seek 
## Copyright
Copyright is a crucial aspect of our daily lives that safeguards the rights of creators and their original works. Copyright applies to the following:
  * Literary, dramatic, musical, or artistic work;
  * Sound recordings, films, broadcasts, or cable programs; and,
  * The typographical arrangement of published editions. 


What sets copyright apart from other intellectual properties is that it automatically exists when a work is created without formal registration.
With the copyright, the owner has the exclusive right to:
  * Copy the work;
  * Issue or make available copies of it to the public;
  * Rent out copies of it to the public;
  * Perform the work;
  * Broadcast the work; and,
  * Adapt the work. 


Copyright enforcement also includes criminal sanctions, with the Customs and Excise Department playing a crucial role. They have the authority to investigate and confiscate suspected infringing copies. Those who commit copyright piracy may face maximum imprisonment and substantial fines of HK$500,000 (US$64,000).
Importing or exporting pirated articles, involvement in copyright piracy outside Hong Kong for importation into the region, and manufacturing equipment for copyright piracy are all considered criminal offenses.
The duration of copyright protection generally extends for 50 years after the creator's death. However, variations exist based on the type of work.
## Registered licensing bodies
Copyright licensing bodies are organizations that copyright owners authorize to grant, on their behalf, licenses to users of copyright works.
The Copyright Ordinance (Cap.528) provides for a voluntary registration scheme for copyright licensing bodies. The scheme aims to enhance the transparency of these bodies by requiring registered licensing bodies to make available to the public essential information such as scales of royalty charges for different uses.
The following are six registered licensing bodies in Hong Kong:
If you wish to apply for the Copyright Licensing Bodies Registry for new registration as a registered licensing body or renewal registration, you must fill out the following specified forms:
Form no. |  Descriptions |  Fee  
---|---|---  
C1 |  Application for Registration by an Unincorporated Body |  HK$2,130 (US$270)  
C2 |  Statement of Particulars in Support of an Application for Registration by an Unincorporated Body |  N/A  
C3 |  Application for Registration by a Body Corporate |  HK$2,130 (US$270)  
C4 |  Statement of Particulars in Support of an Application for Registration by a Body Corporate  |  N/A  
C6 |  Application for Renewal of Registration by an Unincorporated Body |  HK$1,500 (US$191)  
C7 |  Statement of Particulars in Support of an Application for Renewal of Registration by an Unincorporated Body |  N/A  
C8 |  Application for Renewal of Registration by a Body Corporate |  HK$1,500 (US$191)  
C9 |  Statement of Particulars in Support of an Application for Renewal of Registration by a Body Corporate |  N/A

# Annual Leave and Public Holidays in Hong Kong 2025
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/human-resources-and-payroll/statutory-holidays-in-hong-kong)
## Understanding the statutory holidays in Hong Kong for 2025
Hong Kong's statutory holidays are legally mandated days off that all employees are entitled to, regardless of their length of service. This guide will provide a detailed overview of the statutory holidays 2025 in Hong Kong, along with key implications for employers and employees.
  

Contributing Advisor
## Official list of Hong Kong statutory holidays 2025
Hong Kong’s statutory holidays in 2025 are as follows:
  * **Every Sunday**
  * **The first day of January** (1 January, Wednesday)
  * **Lunar New Year’s Day** (29 January, Wednesday)
  * **The second day of the Lunar New Year** (30 January, Thursday)
  * **The third day of the Lunar New Year** (31 January, Friday)
  * **Ching Ming Festival** (4 April, Friday)
  * **Good Friday** (18 April, Friday)
  * **The day following Good Friday** (19 April, Saturday)
  * **Easter Monday** (21 April, Monday)
  * **Labour Day** (1 May, Thursday)
  * **The Birthday of the Buddha** (5 May, Monday)
  * **Tuen Ng Festival** (31 May, Saturday)
  * **Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Establishment Day** (1 July, Tuesday)
  * **National Day** (1 October, Wednesday)
  * **The day following the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival** (7 October, Tuesday)
  * **Chung Yeung Festival** (29 October, Wednesday)
  * **Christmas Day** (25 December, Thursday)
  * **The first weekday after Christmas Day** (26 December, Friday)


Suppose one of these legal holidays coincides with a day off; the employers should provide a day off on the subsequent day, which is neither a legal holiday, an alternative holiday, a replacement holiday, nor a day off.
According to the Employment (Amendment) Ordinance 2021, statutory holidays will be increased progressively to 17 days starting in 2024:
Year |  Newly added statutory holiday |  Number of statutory holidays  
---|---|---  
From 2024 |  The first weekday after Christmas Day |  14  
From 2026 |  Easter Monday |  15  
From 2028 |  Good Friday |  16  
From 2030 |  The day following Good Friday |  17  
Employees who have been employed⟨20⟩ continuously by the same employer for at least three months under a continuous contract (meaning they've worked for four weeks or more, with at least 18 hours worked each week) are entitled to receive pay for statutory holidays. The employers should provide this holiday pay to the employee by their next scheduled wage payment after the statutory holiday.

Employers can request that employees work on statutory holidays, but they must give their employees a minimum of 48 hours prior notice if they intend to do so. In such cases, the employer must also schedule an alternative holiday for the employee within 60 days before or after the statutory holiday. Employers need to maintain clear records documenting the alternative or substitute holiday taken by the employee. Employers are not allowed to offer any payment to employees before granting them a statutory holiday.
Holiday pay should be calculated based on the employee's average daily wages⟨36⟩. It's important to note that substituting holiday payment is prohibited. The government has the authority to impose **fines of up to HK$50,000 (US$** **6,398) on employers** **who fail to provide holidays or pay holiday pay as mandated by law**. Both employers and employees must be aware of these statutory holiday regulations to ensure compliance and fair treatment in the workplace.
## Annual leave
Employees are legally entitled to paid annual leave after completing 12 months of continuous employment with a company. The length of an employee's service determines their entitlement to paid annual leave, which gradually increases from seven days to a maximum of 14 days.
Under continuous contracts, employees can take annual leave with pay. This entitlement escalates from 7 to 14 days based on their years of service.
The timing of annual leave should be mutually agreed upon by employers and employees, with employers providing advance notice. Employees can take their annual leave consecutively or divide it as per their entitlement. It's important to note that employees must be compensated by their employers for their annual leave, which is calculated based on their average daily wages.
Failure to grant or pay annual leave can result in government-imposed fines of up to HK$50,000 (US$6,300). Both employers and employees must be aware of these regulations and ensure compliance with annual leave entitlements and payments.
Entitlement of Paid Annual Leave  
---  
Years of service |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |  9 or more  
Days Leave |  7 |  7 |  8 |  9 |  10 |  11 |  12 |  13 |  14  
Employers can determine when annual leave is to be taken after consultation with the employee or their representative and must give 14 days written notice to the employee of the time that they have selected. Annual leave must, however, be granted within 12 months of the end of the leave year, although in practice, most employers allow annual leave to be taken as it accrues.
Paid annual leave should be granted for an unbroken period unless the employee requires it. For leave entitlement not exceeding 10 days, up to three days can be granted separately, and the employer should grant the balance consecutively. For leave entitlement exceeding 10 days, at least seven days should be granted by the employers consecutively. Any rest day or statutory holiday falling within a period of annual leave will be counted as annual leave, and another rest day or holiday must be appointed.
Did You Know
An employer should not include a term to forgo all or any of the employee's annual leave entitlement in an employment contract, including payment of wages in lieu of any annual leave days.
The law allows an employee to accept payment in lieu of that part of the leave entitlement which exceeds 10 days. For example, if an employee is entitled to 12 days' annual leave, they can take 10 days' leave and accept payment of the equivalent wages for the 2 days' leave.
Employees are entitled to take payment in place of any accrued and untaken statutory annual leave from the previous leave year that exceeds 10 days and are also entitled to compensation for any outstanding annual leave due upon cessation of employment on a pro-rata basis. The law also permits employees to take all untaken yearly leave for 12 months after the preceding leave year.
The daily rate of annual leave pay is equivalent to the average daily wages earned by an employee in the preceding 12-month period. The calculation shall be based on the shorter period if an employee is employed for less than 12 months.

### Common leave year and annual leave shutdown
Employers can elect a common leave year and give employees pro rata leave based on employment duration, while the employees can take or combine pro rata leave with the next leave year.
Employers planning an annual leave shutdown must inform employees a month in advance. And if employees are affected by a shutdown but aren't entitled to paid annual leave, they should be granted it. In addition, the common leave year is not affected by a yearly leave shutdown.
## Sick leave entitlement in Hong Kong
In Hong Kong, the number of sick leave days an employee is entitled to per year depends on the duration of their employment and the accumulation of paid sickness days. Employees accumulate paid sickness days at the following rates:
  * **First 12 months of employment** : 2 paid sickness days for each completed month.
  * **After the first 12 months** : 4 paid sickness days for each completed month.


The maximum number of paid sickness days that can be accumulated is **120 days**. An employee can take paid sick leave if they have accumulated sufficient paid sickness days, and the leave is supported by a valid medical certificate.
It is important to note that employees are only entitled to paid sick leave if the sick leave is not less than four consecutive days, except in cases of pregnancy check-ups, post-confinement medical treatment, or miscarriage.
In summary, the exact number of sick leave days an employee in Hong Kong can take per year varies based on their length of service and the number of days they have accumulated, with a potential maximum of 120 paid sick leave days.
## Maternity leave
An employee who becomes pregnant is entitled to:
  * A continuous period of 14 weeks of maternity leave;
  * If childbirth occurs later than expected, added leave until the child is born; and
  * Additional leave of a maximum of four weeks for illness or disability due to childbirth.


The employee may take leave two to four weeks before the expected date of childbirth, with the employer's agreement. Without such a decision, leave starts four weeks before birth. If childbirth occurs earlier than expected, that day is the starting day of the maternity leave.
The employee is eligible for maternity leave pay if she has worked under a continuous contract for 40 weeks and has given notice to the employer about the pregnancy with a qualified medical certificate provided. However, it should be noted that any extended maternity leave due to late delivery, illness, or disability will be unpaid.
The maternity leave pay is calculated at four-fifths of the employee's average daily wages earned in the 12 months leading up to the first day of the maternity leave. The calculation shall be based on the shorter period if an employee is employed for less than 12 months. 
Employers could apply for the reimbursement of the 11th to 14th weeks of maternity leave pay paid to the employee from the government, subject to a cap of **HK$80,000 (US$10,200)** per employee.
The employee is also entitled to sickness allowance for any day on which the employee has attended a medical examination related to pregnancy, given that a certificate of attendance issued by professionals can be provided as proof.

## Paternity leave
A male employee is entitled to five days’ paternity leave for each confinement of his spouse/partner if he:
  * Is the father of a new-born child or a father-to-be;
  * Has been employed under a continuous contract; and
  * Has given the required notification to the employer.


The employee may take paternity leave at any time from four weeks before the expected date of delivery of the child to 14 weeks beginning on the actual date of delivery of the child. The employee may take all five days of paternity leave in one go or on separate days.
A male employee is entitled to paternity leave pay if he has been employed under a continuous contract for not less than 40 weeks immediately before the day of paternity leave and has provided the birth certificate of his child, on which his name is entered as the child’s father, to the employer within the stipulated period.
The daily rate of paternity leave pay is equivalent to four-fifths of the average daily wages earned by an employee in the 12 months preceding the first day of paternity leave. The calculation shall be based on the shorter period if an employee is employed for less than 12 months.
### Other leave
No other employee leave is defined in Hong Kong law; therefore, two parties shall mutually agree upon all other kinds of employee leave that may be included in the employee's employment contract.

# Filing Individual Tax Returns in Hong Kong: A Complete Guide
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/taxation-and-accounting/filing-individual-tax-returns-in-hong-kong-a-complete-guide)
**_The filing of individual tax returns in Hong Kong has commenced, with deadlines and extensions announced by the Hong Kong tax agency. General taxpayers should submit their tax returns on or before June 3, 2024, while the deadline for submission by sole proprietors of unincorporated businesses is August 2, 2024. A one-month automatic extension is granted to all taxpayers who file their tax returns electronically. Hong Kong taxpayers are advised to start preparations early and allocate sufficient resources to meet this tight deadline._**

Hong Kong Inland Revenue Department (IRD) has 
In this article, we will introduce you to the individual tax return obligations in Hong Kong and provide a complete guide. 
## What is the individual tax return in Hong Kong?
Individual tax return involves the comprehensive reporting of personal financial information, such as income, deductions, and credits, which will be used to calculate the taxes owed or the tax refund due to the taxpayer. 
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/taxation-and-accounting/filing-individual-tax-returns-in-hong-kong-a-complete-guide)
In Hong Kong, the individual tax return consists of Tax Return - Individual (BIR60), the Appendix to BIR 60, and any required supplementary forms. Every year at the beginning of May, the IRD issues the individual tax returns for individual taxpayers. 
Relevant taxpayers should complete, sign, and return the individual tax returns to the IRD within the time limit stipulated in the return, regardless of whether they have income that is chargeable to tax or not. 
## Who should complete the individual tax return in Hong Kong?
Individual tax returns are issued to individual taxpayers to report their salaries, rental income from solely owned properties, and profits from sole-proprietorship businesses, and to elect personal assessment. 
If the taxpayer is married for all or part of the year and has elected joint assessment / personal assessment or has been nominated by their spouse to claim home loan interest deduction, their BIR60 should also be signed by the spouse. 
## When to file the individual tax return in Hong Kong?
### Time limit
The individual tax return should be filed: 
  * within one month from the date of issue of the tax return if the taxpayer did not solely own any unincorporated business during the year of assessment; or
  * within three months from the date of issue of the tax return if the taxpayer solely owned any unincorporated business during the year of assessment.

Given that an automatic extension of one month will be given for filing the tax return for the year of assessment 2023/24 electronically, the deadlines for filing the individual tax returns in 2024 are:  **Deadlines for Filing Individual Tax Returns in Hong Kong 2024**  
---  
**Deadlines for normal filing** | **Deadlines for e-filing**  
General taxpayers | June 3, 2024 | July 3, 2024  
Sole proprietors owning any unincorporated business during the year of assessment | August 2, 2024 | September 2, 2024  
### Extensions
In addition to the automatic extension granted to e-filings, there are two types of extensions available for individual tax return filing – extension based on the Block Extension Scheme and extension based on individual application for difficulties. 
Under the **Block Extension Scheme** , an extension of time for submission of tax returns is granted to those individual taxpayers who have appointed a tax representative. Requests for extension beyond the extended due dates would be granted only in the most exceptional circumstances. Applications for further extension should be made in writing on a case-by-case basis. If the reasons or exceptional circumstances are the same for employees of a particular company, the requests for further extensions could be made by way of a list. 
An**individual application for extension** is granted to those individual taxpayers who have great difficulties in submitting their tax return in time. The applicant should state the reason why the tax return cannot be submitted within the prescribed time. Such application will only be granted in exceptional circumstances. 
## What documents should be submitted?
In general, relevant individual taxpayers should submit the BIR 60, the Appendix to BIR 60, and any required supplementary forms. 
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/taxation-and-accounting/filing-individual-tax-returns-in-hong-kong-a-complete-guide)
Documentary evidence in support of the deduction or allowance claims need not be submitted. However, taxpayers should retain such documentation for a period of at least six years after the expiration of the relevant year of assessment. The taxpayer may be required to provide such evidence in the event that their case is subsequently selected for review. 
If the taxpayer claims relief under any Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) or applies for full or partial exemption of income, supporting documents should be submitted with the return. 
## How to file the individual tax return?
The individual tax return can be filed by paper or by electronic filing. 
If the taxpayer chooses to file a paper tax return, they must submit the **original tax return** issued by the government. Photocopies or fax copies of tax returns are not acceptable. Filing a copy of the BIR60 which was downloaded from the Internet is also not acceptable. 
The paper tax return can be then submitted by post or in person. 
For those who want to file their individual tax returns **through the Internet** , they can only do so if they: 
  * do not claim exemption in respect of part or all of their salaries income;
  * do not own any sole proprietorship business with a gross annual income of more than HK$2,000,000 for that year of assessment;
  * do not have any deemed assessable profits pursuant to section 20AE, 20AF, 20AX and/or 20AY of the Inland Revenue Ordinance for that year of assessment;
  * have not obtained an advance ruling on any of their tax matters in relation to that year of assessment; and
  * do not claim any double taxation relief pursuant to an arrangement specified under section 49(1) or 49(1A) of the Inland Revenue Ordinance for that year of assessment.


## How to fulfill the individual tax return obligation efficiently?
For individual who are employees, they are suggested to collect a copy of the IR56B form⟨70⟩ from the employer before preparing the employment income part in individual tax returns. 
For sole proprietors, they need to report the business profits generated under sole proprietorship according to the financial statements for the period from April 1, 2023 to March 31, 2024. 
Relevant individual taxpayers are advised to collect and keep sufficient supporting documents related to the income, deductions, and allowances claimed in the individual tax return. 
For taxpayers who have assessable income but do not receive the individual tax returns from the IRD by early May, they should promptly request the tax agency to issue a return. 
Non-compliance with filing requirements, including late filing or making incorrect returns, can result in penalties or even criminal prosecutions. Taxpayers are well advised to seek professional advice from qualified tax consultants if they are unsure how to handle their individual tax return obligations.

# Property Tax in Hong Kong
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/taxation-and-accounting/other-taxes)
Property tax is levied on income arising from the letting of immovable property⟨70⟩ in Hong Kong, which is payable by the owner(s) at the standard rate of the year of assessment on “net assessable value.”

Under the provisions of the Inland Revenue Ordinance, every joint owner or owner in common is responsible for reporting rental income on tax returns and paying property tax as if they are the sole owner.
Where the owner receives only rent and no other benefit, the annual rent is the “assessable value.” The assessable value should include rent receivable (due but not yet received). Irrecoverable rent can be excluded from tax charges in the year in which it became irrecoverable. Any amount subsequently recovered is assessable to tax as income in the year of recovery.
The property tax is paid on 15 percent of the net assessable value:
  * If the tenant pays rates, the net assessable value is equal to the assessable value less a standard allowance of 20 percent for repairs and outgoings;
  * If the owner is responsible for paying rates, rates paid can be deducted before allowing for the 20 percent standards allowance.


Rates are an indirect tax imposed on properties. These rates are calculated at five percent of the rateable value, i.e., a property's estimated annual rental value determined as of the designated valuation reference date, typically set on October 1.
A year of assessment runs from April 1 to March 31 of the following year.
## Obligations and penalties
Section 71(1) of the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Cap. 112) outlines the procedures for paying taxes as per this Ordinance. It stipulates that individuals or entities subject to taxation under this Ordinance must follow the payment instructions provided in the assessment notice.
Tax payments must be made on or before the specific due date indicated in the assessment notice. Failure to make timely payments will result in the taxes being considered as in default.
If the first installment of taxes, as specified in the assessment notice, is not paid by the designated due date, the second installment will immediately become due. Any remaining unpaid balance of the total tax indicated in the assessment notice will also be considered in default, and it will become immediately recoverable.
The Commissioner of Inland Revenue possesses the authority to take necessary steps to recover the outstanding tax amount. These recovery actions may include imposing a five percent surcharge on the balance mentioned in the demand notice, issuing a recovery notice to third parties, and initiating legal actions, among other measures.
## Tax relief for business properties
If the income generated from your property is subject to Property Tax and is also considered part of your Profits Taxable income⟨25⟩, or if you utilize the property you own for business-related activities, you could reduce the amount of Profits Tax you owe by deducting the Property Tax paid.
Furthermore, corporations engaged in trade, professions, or businesses in Hong Kong can request a written exemption from paying Property Tax. This exemption can help avoid the Property Tax from being offset against their Profits Tax liability.
The 2024-25 Budget introduces a variety of support measures for Hong Kong residents and companies.
The support measures include rate concessions for both domestic and non-domestic properties in the first quarter of the 2024-25 fiscal year. This concession, capped at HK$1,000 (US$127.73) per rateable property, is estimated to benefit approximately 3.08 million domestic properties and 430,000 non-domestic properties, resulting in a reduction of government revenue by HK$2.6 billion (US$332 million) and HK$370 million (US$47.26 million), respectively.
## Provisional property tax
Property tax is chargeable on net assessable value for each year of assessment. As the net assessable value for any particular year can only be known after the end of the year concerned, a provisional tax charge must be raised. When the net assessable value for the year of assessment is subsequently ascertained, an assessment will be made, and the provisional property tax paid will be utilized to offset the tax liability under the assessment.
Did You Know
Did you know? The taxpayer can apply in writing for holding over the whole or part of the provisional property tax on the grounds as specified in the Inland Revenue Ordinance.
## Property tax calculations
Property taxes are calculated based on the standard rate, which is applied to the net assessable value of the property for the specific assessment year. The assessment year spans from April 1**to March 31** of the subsequent year. The net assessable value is determined through the following method:
## Application grounds
If you need an extension to pay your provisional property tax, there are several legitimate reasons for making such a request. Here's a breakdown of the situations that warrant an extension:
  * **Assessed Value Decrease:** If the assessed value for the current tax year, which serves as the basis for your provisional tax assessment, is expected to fall below 90 percent of either the previous year's assessed value or the estimated assessable value for which you're obligated to pay provisional tax, you have grounds for requesting a deferral. For example, suppose your provisional property tax is calculated based on an assessed value of **HK$300,000 (US$ 38,300)**. In that case, you can apply for a deferral if the assessed value for the current year is projected to be less than **HK$270,000 (US$ 34,500)**.
  * **Ownership Cessation:** If you've either already relinquished ownership of the property or plan to do so before the end of the tax year for which provisional tax was assessed, resulting in a reduction in the assessed value used for provisional tax calculation, you must provide detailed information regarding the cessation of ownership and the rental income you have received or anticipate receiving in support of your request.
  * **Personal Assessment Choice:** If you've opted for personal assessment for the tax year in question and this decision is expected to lower your overall tax liability, you can request an extension for your provisional tax payment.
  * **Filed Objection:** In case you've objected to your property tax assessment for the immediate prior year, which directly affects the provisional tax assessment year, you are also eligible to apply for a deferral of provisional tax payment.


### Application time limit
Your application for holding over of provisional tax should be lodged no later than:
  * 28 days before the due date for payment of the provisional tax or
  * 14 days after the date of issue of the notice for payment of the provisional tax, whichever is later.


If the provisional tax is payable in two installments and the first installment has been settled by the due date, an application for holding over the whole or part of the second installment may be made subject to the prescribed time limit and grounds for the application.
## Property tax returns (BIR57 or BIR58)
Property tax returns are distributed to various property stakeholders, including joint owners, co-owners, corporations, and associations of individuals. However, if you are the exclusive property owner, you should disclose your rental income in the Tax Return - Individuals (BIR60).
There are two distinct sets of property tax return forms available:
## Tax returns filing deadline
Companies must file Property Tax Returns BIR57 and BIR58 within one month from the date of issuance. If your situation aligns with the criteria established by the Commissioner, and you opt for online submission, you will automatically receive a two-week extension.

# List of Licensed Banks in Hong Kong 2025
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/tools/list-of-licensed-banks-in-hong-kong-2023)
Hong Kong's well-earned reputation as a prominent hub for banking and finance ⟨3⟩is supported by its thriving economy⟨5⟩, favorable regulatory environment⟨19⟩, and strategic location⟨6⟩, which have attracted some of the world's largest and most influential banks.
This article delves into the largest banks in Hong Kong, offering valuable insights into their operations, services, and contributions to the region's financial sector. Hong Kong's largest banks play a crucial role in supporting businesses, investments, and trade, facilitating economic growth⟨7⟩ and development on both regional and international scales⟨8⟩.
## Regulatory framework
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) plays a role in ensuring the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's banking system. As the primary regulator, the HKMA supervises licensed banks to maintain a robust financial sector. It oversees the implementation of prudent risk management practices, monitors systemic risks, and ensures that banks comply with local and international standards, including Basel III requirements.
The HKMA’s responsibilities also include fostering the efficiency and development of the banking sector, managing Hong Kong’s Exchange Fund, and safeguarding the stability of the Hong Kong Dollar.
The **Banking Ordinance** (Cap. 155) is the core legislative framework that governs banking operations in Hong Kong. It provides the legal structure for the licensing, supervision, and regulation of banks, with the overarching aim of ensuring financial stability, protecting depositors, and maintaining public confidence in the banking system. Here is the key aspects of the Banking Ordinance:
  * Licensing and Authorization of Banks;
  * Capital adequacy requirements;
  * Supervisory framework;
  * Prudential requirements;
  * Corporate governance;
  * Consumer protection;
  * Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF);
  * Resolution and recovery;
  * Penalties and enforcement; and,
  * Cross-border banking.


## Types of banks in Hong Kong
The ordinance distinguishes three types of authorized institutions (AIs) that can operate banking services in Hong Kong:
  * **Licensed Banks** : These institutions are authorized to accept deposits and offer various banking services, including current and savings accounts, loans, and foreign exchange. Well-known institutions such as;
    * Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited;
    * Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC); and,
    * Citibank (Hong Kong) Limited.
  * **Restricted License Banks** : These institutions are allowed to take deposits of at least HK$500,000 and engage in activities like merchant banking and private banking. Well-known institutions such as;
    * J. P. Morgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Limited;
    * Goldman Sachs Asia Bank Limited;
    * Deposit-taking companies;
    * BPI International Finance Limited; and,
    * Chong Hing Finance Limited.
  * **Deposit-taking Companies** : They can take deposits of HK$100,000 or more with a maturity of at least three months. These companies typically offer specialized services like consumer credit or trade financing.


The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is responsible for granting licenses and authorizations based on strict criteria, including the institution's capital adequacy, management structure, and business plans.
## The biggest banks in Hong Kong 
As a global financial hub, Hong Kong is home to many of the world’s largest and most influential banking institutions. The city’s banking landscape is highly competitive, with over 150 licensed banks operating under strict regulatory standards. Notably, more than 70 of the top 100 banks globally have a presence in Hong Kong, making it one of the most concentrated banking sectors in the world. This section provides an overview of some of the biggest banks shaping Hong Kong’s financial ecosystem, from local giants to international powerhouses.
### HSBC Hong Kong
HSBC (The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation) is one of the most recognizable names in global banking, and its roots are deeply embedded in Hong Kong’s financial history. Founded in 1865, HSBC was initially established to facilitate trade between Europe and Asia. Today, HSBC is one of the largest banks in the world by assets, and its Hong Kong arm remains a critical part of its global operations.
As Hong Kong’s largest bank, HSBC dominates the local banking sector with a broad range of services, including retail, corporate, investment banking, and wealth management. Its deep integration into Hong Kong’s economy and significant market share make HSBC the go-to bank for businesses and individuals alike. With a commitment to innovation, HSBC has been at the forefront of digital banking services in the region, solidifying its role as a market leader.
### Bank of China (Hong Kong)
Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited (BOCHK) is another dominant player in the city’s financial landscape. Although its history dates back to the early 20th century, BOCHK was incorporated in 2001, creating a consolidated banking group under the Bank of China. BOCHK has established itself as one of Hong Kong’s largest banking institutions, offering comprehensive financial services, including retail banking, treasury, and investment services.
One of BOCHK’s key strengths lies in its strong connections to mainland China, which positions it as a gateway for cross-border banking services between Hong Kong and China. This strategic advantage has helped BOCHK build a large client base among both local and international companies seeking to expand in mainland China. The bank also plays a significant role in promoting the internationalization of the Renminbi (RMB), further enhancing its global stature.
### Hang Seng Bank
Hang Seng Bank, a subsidiary of HSBC, is renowned for its focus on serving local retail and small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Founded in 1933, Hang Seng is one of Hong Kong’s largest listed companies. The bank’s services span retail banking, wealth management, and commercial banking, making it a trusted choice for personal finance solutions.
Hang Seng’s most distinctive offering is its **Hang Seng Index (HSI)** , which has become one of Asia’s most widely followed stock market indices. This strong local identity, coupled with its customer-first approach, has allowed Hang Seng to maintain a solid customer base in Hong Kong, particularly among individuals seeking personal loans, savings accounts, and mortgages. Its reputation for quality service has led to high levels of customer loyalty.
### Standard Chartered Hong Kong
Standard Chartered Hong Kong holds a unique position as a bank that merges local expertise with a broad international presence. With over 150 years of history in the city, Standard Chartered is a household name in Hong Kong’s banking industry. The bank offers an array of services, including corporate banking, retail banking, and wealth management, catering to both local and multinational clients.
One of the key strengths of Standard Chartered is its focus on corporate and institutional banking, serving clients across the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. Its global footprint, combined with its deep understanding of local markets, enables the bank to offer tailored financial solutions that address the complex needs of large corporations and high-net-worth individuals.
### Citibank Hong Kong
Citibank Hong Kong, the local arm of U.S.-based Citigroup, has been a fixture in the city since 1902. It is known for its focus on international banking services, making it particularly popular among expatriates, multinational corporations, and high-net-worth individuals seeking global financial services.
Citibank offers a wide range of services, including retail banking, wealth management, and investment banking. Its global reach allows it to offer clients seamless cross-border banking services, which are especially valued in a city as internationally connected as Hong Kong. The bank has also been a key player in driving innovation in the financial sector, particularly in areas such as digital banking and fintech partnerships.

# Tax Incentives for Foreign Sourced Entities
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/taxation-and-accounting/tax-incentives-in-hong-kong)
Hong Kong's tax landscape is characterized by a generally low-tax environment⟨24⟩ with specific incentives tailored to different sectors. While the region does not provide extensive tax incentives⟨1⟩ for all companies, it benefits critical industries such as aviation services, financial services, and the shipping sector.

Did You Know
Offshore funds that meet specific criteria can also be exempt from profits tax.
Further, to support economic growth and SMEs, Hong Kong offers 45 funding schemes across various industries. The SME ReachOut service team assists in identifying eligible schemes and navigating the application process, spanning various industries and business operations. Popular schemes include:
  * The Dedicated Fund for Branding,
  * Export Marketing Fund (EMF),
  * Technology Voucher Programme (TVP), and
  * The Enterprise Support Scheme.


Each is designed to address specific business needs and promote growth⟨7⟩.
Hong Kong uses tax incentives to attract investment across sectors. These incentives encompass 100 percent write-offs for new expenditures on manufacturing machinery, exemptions for capital expenditures related to environmental protection and intellectual property rights, and reduced profit tax rates for the aviation industry.
The region also encourages research and development activities by offering businesses 100 percent standard tax deductions for payments to educational and research institutions engaged in R&D efforts. Hong Kong's tax policies aim to support various industries, stimulate economic growth, and promote innovation.

## Two-tiered profits tax rates
Hong Kong has implemented a two-tier tax profits tax⟨25⟩ system, where the first HK$2 million (US$255,000) of assessable profits for qualified enterprises is taxed at a reduced rate of 8.25 percent rather than the standard 16.5 percent. This system aims to ease the tax burden on smaller businesses.
Two-Tiered Profits Tax Rates in Hong Kong  
---  
Assessable profits |  Corporations |  Unincorporated businesses  
First HK$2 million |  8.25% |  7.5%  
Over HK$2 million |  16.5% |  15%  
Note that only one may elect the two-tiered profits tax rates for two or more connected entities. All other entities are still taxed at the 16.5 percent rate for corporations and 15 percent for incorporated businesses.
In addition to the two-tier tax regime, Hong Kong does not have a value-added tax (VAT), meaning that businesses are not subject to additional taxes on products or services provided.
## Tax exemption on offshore profits
Hong Kong does not charge tax on profits or revenue earned offshore under the so-called “territorial source principle of taxation.” This means that the profits tax is only levied if profits are derived in Hong Kong, the company carries out business in Hong Kong, and this Hong Kong-based business generates profit.

Hong Kong has implemented the 
In relation to the FSIE regime, Hong Kong’s Inland Revenue Department (IRD) amended provisions of the Inland Revenue Ordinance (IRO) so that it will now levy profits tax on certain types of foreign-sourced income that have been raised by a member of a multinational enterprise (MNE) group which carries out business or trade in Hong Kong when it receives this income in Hong Kong.
This foreign-sourced income includes passive income such as interest, dividend, disposal gain, and income from intellectual property.
Certain types of companies, such as regulated financial entities, are exempted from the FSIE regime regarding income derived from interest, dividends, or disposal gain.
## Tax deductions
Hong Kong allows for a wide range of tax deductions that can help businesses reduce their overall tax burden. According to Hong Kong’s revenue department, “all outgoings and expenses, to the extent to which the taxpayer has incurred them in the production of chargeable profits, are allowed as deductions.”
Certain expenses **are not** deductible when calculating assessable profits. These are:
  * Domestic or private expenses and any sums not expended for the purpose of producing the profits;
  * Any loss or withdrawal of capital, the cost of improvements, and any expenditure of a capital nature;
  * Any sum recoverable under insurance or contract of indemnity;
  * Rent of or expenses relating to premises not occupied or used for the purpose of producing the profits;
  * Taxes payable under the I.R.O., except Salaries Tax paid in respect of employees' remuneration;
  * Any remuneration or interest on capital or loans payable to or, subject to section 16AA, contribution made to a mandatory provident fund scheme in respect of the proprietor or the proprietor's spouse or, in case of a partnership, to its partners or their spouses.


Certain expenses, mostly those related to upgrading infrastructure for environmental protection, are eligible for deductions over a longer period. These are listed in the table below.
Deductible Expenses  
---  
Expenditure |  Details  
Building refurbishment |  Deductible over a period of five years in equal installments commencing in the year in which the expenditure was made.  
Plant and machinery specially related to manufacturing, and on computer hardware and software |  A full deduction is allowed in the basis period in which the expenditure was incurred.  
Environmental protection facilities |  From the year of assessment 2008/09, a full deduction is allowed during the basis period in which the expenditure is incurred.  
Environmental protection installation |  From 2008/09, a deduction of 20% of the expenditure is allowed in each of the five consecutive years commencing from the year in which the expenditure is incurred. From 2018/19, a full deduction is allowed during the basis period (instead of over five years) in which the expenditure is incurred for procuring environmental protection installations [including any part of expenditure on environmental protection installation that remains to be deducted (and is to be fully deducted) in the year of assessment 2018/19].  
Environmentally friendly vehicles |  From 2010/11, a full deduction is allowed during the basis period in which the expenditure is incurred.

### Depreciation allowances
Hong Kong provides depreciation allowances for businesses to reduce their tax burden. The permitted allowances are detailed in the table below.
Depreciation Allowances  
---  
Industrial buildings allowances on industrial buildings and structures | 
  * Initial allowance: 20% on the cost of construction of the premises
  * Annual allowance: 4% on the cost of construction of the premises

Balancing allowance or charge will be due upon disposal of the premises  
Commercial buildings allowances on commercial buildings and structures | 
  * Annual allowance: 4% on the cost of construction of the premises

Balancing allowance or charge will be due upon disposal of the premises  
Plant and machinery | 
  * Initial allowance: 60% of the cost
  * Annual allowance: at rates of 10%, 20%, or 30% as prescribed by the Board of Inland Revenue in the Inland Revenue Rules, on the reducing value of the asset. Items qualifying for the same rate of annual allowance are grouped under one "pool."

A balancing allowance is available only on cessation of a business with no successor. A balancing charge can, however, arise whenever the disposal proceeds of one or more assets exceed the reducing value of the whole "pool" of assets to which the disposed items belong.

### Donations
Charitable donations can be deducted from the assessable profits if:
  * They are made to 
  * In aggregate, total at least HK$100 (US$12.7) but do not exceed 35 percent of the adjusted assessable profits before deduction of donations (10 percent for years of assessment up to and including 2002/03; and 25 percent for years of assessment 2003/04 to 2007/08).


"Approved charitable donation" means a donation of money to:
  * Any charitable institution or trust of a public character that is exempt from tax under section 88 of the Inland Revenue Ordinance, or
  * To the government for charitable purposes.


### No value-added tax (VAT)
Hong Kong has no Value Added Tax (VAT) system to spare businesses from extra taxes on their products and services. In contrast, many other countries impose VAT rates as high as 20 percent, substantially significantly increasing business costs.

Securing an employment visa in Hong Kong is a critical step for foreign nationals looking to work legally in the region. Whether you are a professional, entrepreneur, or recent graduate, there are various Hong Kong work visa options to suit different needs

A visa or entry permit⟨70⟩ is required to work, study, establish⟨10⟩, or join any business or residence in the HK SAR.
However, if an individual holds any of the following travel documents, no visa or entry permit shall be required for any purpose:
  * Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Passport;
  * British National (Overseas) Passport;
  * Hong Kong Certificate of Identity;
  * Hong Kong Re-entry permit (for entry from mainland China and the Macau Special Administrative Region only);
  * Hong Kong Seaman's Identity Book;
  * Hong Kong Document of Identity for Visa Purposes provided that the document is valid or the holder's limit of stay in Hong Kong has not expired;
  * Travel documents bearing one of the following endorsements:
    * Holder's eligibility for Hong Kong permanent identity card verified;
    * The document holder has the right to land in Hong Kong.


## Types of employment visa in Hong Kong
All foreign nationals must obtain a visa to work in Hong Kong. Obtaining a work visa for a foreign national can be challenging, as companies need to prove that there is a genuine need for foreign talent⟨20⟩ and that a local professional cannot fill the vacancy.
Hong Kong offers various employment and investment visa options, including:
  * The General Employment Policy (GEP) visa is a common type of employment visa in Hong Kong, designed for foreign professionals whose expertise is not readily available in the local workforce.
  * Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals (ASMTP) visa is an employment visa for Chinese residents from Mainland China who have special skills, knowledge, or experience valuable to Hong Kong.
  * Immigration Arrangements for Non-local Graduates (IANG) visa is an employment visa for non-local students who have graduated from a full-time, locally-accredited program in Hong Kong. Recent graduates can apply to stay and work in Hong Kong for 12 months without needing a job offer.
  * Second Generation of Chinese Hong Kong Permanent Residents visa is for the second generation of Chinese Hong Kong permanent residents who were born overseas.
  * Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (CIES) is an employment visa for individuals who invest at least HKD 30 million in permissible investment assets in Hong Kong.


The visa type that is most suitable for foreign investors is the employment visa under the General Employment Policy.
Other work visas cater to entrepreneurs and semi-skilled workers, such as technicians. To qualify for an employment visa, applicants must possess skills, knowledge, or experience not readily available in Hong Kong, with different rules for Mainland Chinese applicants.
### Work visa eligibility requirements
To obtain an employment visa in Hong Kong, applicants must meet several criteria, including relevant academic or professional qualifications, a confirmed job offer, and a remuneration package that matches market standards:
### General Employment Policy (GEP) Visa
The General Employment Policy (GEP) visa is a widely utilized employment visa in Hong Kong, aimed at foreign professionals possessing expertise not readily available in the local market. The GEP visa is open to non-Chinese nationals and does not have sector or quota limitations. Applicants must meet several criteria, including:
  * Possessing a solid educational background (typically a degree);
  * Securing an employment offer in Hong Kong relevant to their qualifications; and.
  * Receiving compensation that matches the prevailing market standards in the city.


Notably, applicants are required to show that the role they are applying for cannot be filled by local professionals, emphasizing the need for specialized skills or experience.
### Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals (ASMTP) Visa
  
For Chinese Mainland residents with unique skills or expertise that contribute value to Hong Kong’s workforce, the Admission Scheme for Mainland Talents and Professionals (ASMTP) offers a streamlined employment visa pathway in Hong Kong. Similar to the GEP, this visa program is also quota-free and not limited to any specific sector. Applicants under the ASMTP must:
  * Demonstrate that their expertise is not readily available within the local talent pool; and,
  * They have secured a relevant job offer in Hong Kong.


A strong educational background, professional qualifications, and evidence of a competitive remuneration package aligned with Hong Kong's market norms are crucial for successful applications.
### Immigration Arrangements for Non-local Graduates (IANG) Visa
  
The IANG employment visa is designed for non-local graduates who have completed a full-time, accredited program at a Hong Kong institution. The program provides graduates with the opportunity to stay and work in Hong Kong for up to 12 months, without requiring a job offer at the time of application.
Recent graduates applying within six months of their graduation date are particularly advantaged, as they are granted the flexibility to explore employment options post-graduation. After this initial period, applicants can further extend their stay in Hong Kong by securing a job offer. This visa supports Hong Kong's objective of retaining international talent educated within its borders.
### Second Generation of Chinese Hong Kong Permanent Residents Visa
  
This employment visa category is tailored for individuals who are part of the second generation of Chinese Hong Kong permanent residents but were born overseas. It allows them to live and work in Hong Kong, thus reconnecting with their heritage while contributing to the local economy.
Applicants are required to demonstrate their Hong Kong roots and typically need to provide proof of their parents' permanent residency in Hong Kong, alongside other general immigration requirements.
### Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (CIES)
  
The Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (CIES) once provided a route for individuals willing to invest a minimum of HK$30 million in Hong Kong’s permissible investment assets to gain residency.
Successful applicants were not required to be engaged in active employment, making this visa a popular choice among high-net-worth individuals looking to establish residence in Hong Kong through substantial financial investment. The scheme helped boost the local economy by attracting foreign investment, though recent policy changes have since closed this entry pathway.
### Documents requirements for employment visas in Hong Kong
Apart from the application form, the following documents need to be submitted for employment visas in Hong Kong:
  * From the employee:
    * Passport;
    * Copy of academic qualifications and relevant work experience; and,
    * Recent photo.
  * From the employer:
    * The company’s employment contract or letter of appointment to the applicant containing information about the post, salary, other fringe benefits, and employment periods;
    * Photocopy of the Business Registration Certificate;
    * Photocopy of proof of financial standing, such as an audited financial report;
    * Documents with details of company background such as business activities; and,
    * Detailed business plan.


Applicants must collect and deliver these documents to the Immigration Department of Hong Kong SAR. Foreigners residing in the Chinese Mainland at the time of application must submit these documents to the Immigration Division of the Hong Kong Government in Beijing.
### Processing time for Hong Kong's employment visas
The processing of the work visa application takes about four weeks. If the visa application is granted, the government will issue an e-visa, and no stamp or affixing needed for the passport anymore. At this point, the fees need to be paid as well. With the label attached to the passport, the applicant can enter and work in Hong Kong.
## Comparison of Hong Kong work visa options
To attract and retain highly skilled and sought-after talent, Hong Kong has introduced several talent visa schemes to facilitate obtaining a work visa. This initiation includes visa schemes for foreign graduates of Hong Kong universities and highly skilled and experienced talent.
The different work visa policies and talent schemes are summarized in the table below.

## Business and entrepreneurial visas
Hong Kong has introduced a range of visa schemes to enable people to come to Hong Kong for business or investment without having to work for an existing company. One such scheme is “Investment as Entrepreneurs,” which enables people to relocate to Hong Kong while working for their business.
To be eligible for this type of visa, applicants must prove that their business can substantially contribute to Hong Kong’s economy. The immigration authorities may consider factors such as business plans, business turnover, financial resources, investment sum, the number of jobs created locally, and the introduction of new technology or skills. Details of these factors can be found 
Other types of business visas include:
  * Training visa - a visa of up to 12 months for applicants traveling to Hong Kong for training to acquire particular skills and knowledge not available in the applicant's country/territory of domicile.
  * Working holiday visas - Citizens of participating countries between the ages of 18 and 30 whose primary intention in traveling to Hong Kong is for a holiday but want to take up short-term employment or short-term study or training. Subject to a quota by country.
  * APEC Business Travel Card (ABTC) Scheme - Citizens of the 21 APEC member economies are eligible for the ABTC, enabling them to travel to any APEC member region for two to three months for business purposes, including Hong Kong.


For short-term business trips to Hong Kong, citizens of visa-free eligible countries do not need a visa. Those from non-eligible countries can apply for a general visitor visa.
Frequent travelers to Hong Kong can apply for a "Travel Pass," valid for three years. This pass allows multiple visits, each lasting up to two months. To qualify, applicants must demonstrate a "genuine need" for frequent Hong Kong travel, having visited at least three times in the past year (excluding trips to and from mainland China). Proof of "genuine need" may include an employer's statement or an essential Hong Kong business contact letter for business-related visits.
## Visitor’s visa
Hong Kong grants a visa-free period for citizens of most countries, usually for 7, 14, 30, or 90 days, depending on the country in question. Exceptions are for British nationals who may stay in Hong Kong for up to 180 days without a visa. Visitors must apply for a visa or entry permit before traveling to the HKSAR to stay longer than the allowed visa-free period.
Did You Know
Visitors are required to have adequate funds to cover the duration of their stay without working and to hold onward or return tickets unless they are in transit to the mainland of China or the Macau SAR.
Visitors are not allowed to take up employment (paid or unpaid), to establish or join in any business, or to enter school as a student, where other types of visa or entry permit might be applied.
## Renewing the Hong Kong work and employment visas
Renewals of employment visas for non-permanent residents can be done 
Non-permanent residents in Hong Kong who have obtained an employment visa through any of the following schemes may apply for an extension within four weeks of the expiration of their limit of stay:
  * General Employment Policy (GEP)
  * Admission Scheme for the Second Generation of Chinese Hong Kong Permanent Residents
  * Entrepreneurs
  * Non-Mainland students and their dependents
  * Descendants of Hong Kong permanent residents and Hong Kong residents


Applicants who have obtained a visa through the above schemes must submit a completed and signed form ID 91 to apply for an extension.
Applicants who are dependents should also submit form ID 481A, which must be completed and signed by the sponsor. If the dependent is a spouse or civil partner, they must also complete and sign form ID 481B. All of these forms can be obtained free of charge from the Immigration Department Headquarters and the Immigration Branch Offices or downloaded here.

"What are the differences between a work visa and an employment visa in Hong Kong?"
#### "What are the differences between a work visa and an employment visa in Hong Kong?"
In Hong Kong, the terms “work visa” and “employment visa” are often used interchangeably. Both refer to the legal document that allows a foreign national to reside and work in Hong Kong. The most common type of employment visa is issued under the **General Employment Policy (GEP)** , which is designed for professionals with special skills, knowledge, or experience that are not readily available in Hong Kong.
"How difficult is it to get an employment visa in Hong Kong?"
#### "How difficult is it to get an employment visa in Hong Kong?"
Securing an employment visa in Hong Kong can be challenging due to several factors:
  * You must have **a confirmed job offer from a Hong Kong employer** who is willing to sponsor your visa.
  * You need to demonstrate that you possess the necessary qualifications, skills, and experience for the job. Typically, this includes having a relevant degree and professional experience.
  * The employer must prove that the position cannot be filled by a local candidate. This is often the most difficult criterion to meet.


Despite these challenges, the process is relatively straightforward once you meet the criteria, and the application is free of charge.
"Do I need a visa for travel to Hong Kong?"
#### "Do I need a visa for travel to Hong Kong?"
Visa requirements for Hong Kong depend on your nationality, the purpose of your visit, and the length of your stay. Many nationalities—including citizens from the US, Canada, most EU countries, Australia, and New Zealand—can enter Hong Kong visa-free for short stays (often up to 90 days, though this can vary). However, if you plan to work, study, or stay longer than the permitted period, you will need to apply for an appropriate visa.
It's always best to check the latest information on the official Hong Kong Immigration Department website or contact your local consulate before you travel, as visa policies can change.

![Withholding Tax in Hong Kong ⟨69⟩]
# Withholding Tax in Hong Kong 
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/taxation-and-accounting/withholding-tax-in-hong-kong)
Resident and non-resident businesses are subject to the same tax rules. While Hong Kong maintains a tax-friendly environment with no dividend tax for both resident and non-resident businesses, companies are required to pay taxes on profits earned in or originating from Hong Kong.

They are required to pay taxes on profits⟨25⟩ earned in or originating from Hong Kong.
When a company pays for services provided by someone or a business from outside Hong Kong, they need to hold back a part of that payment and send it to the Hong Kong Inland Revenue Department. The percentage of the amount withheld is the withholding tax.
## Who is eligible for withholding tax?
Non-resident enterprises and individuals that derive income from a Hong Kong source for services rendered in Hong Kong are charged withholding tax.
  * Non-resident enterprises are defined as companies in which central management and control are exercised from outside Hong Kong.
  * Non-resident individuals are defined as foreigners who have stayed or worked in Hong Kong for less than 180 days in the tax year.


## Which payments are subject to withholding tax?
Not all payments are subject to withholding tax in Hong Kong. There is no withholding tax on interest and dividends from investments, deposits, and shareholding, meaning businesses do not face a dividend tax for investments or shareholding returns. Royalties and certain performance service fees are subject to withholding tax in Hong Kong.
## Withholding tax for royalties
Royalties include fees for using, distributing, or exhibiting copyrighted materials (recorded music, books, films, marketing materials, and the like), patents and trademarks⟨70⟩, and intellectual property⟨17⟩ (IP).
Did You Know
The withholding tax rate on royalties varies depending on whether the non-resident recipient is associated/affiliated with the Hong Kong resident payer.
### Withholding tax for royalties paid to non-resident enterprises
  * When making royalty payments to non-resident companies that are closely connected, a withholding tax of 16.5 percent applies. However, if any other businesses in Hong Kong have never owned intellectual property (IP), a reduced rate of 4.95 percent is applicable.
  * For royalty payments to non-resident companies with no close connections, a withholding tax rate of 4.95 percent is imposed.
  * If a Hong Kong company previously owned the same IP held by a non-resident company, the entire royalty amount could be considered part of the Hong Kong company's taxable income.


### Withholding tax for royalties paid to non-resident individuals
  * Royalty payments to affiliate non-resident individuals face a withholding tax rate of 15 percent.
  * Royalty payments to unaffiliated non-resident individuals are subject to a withholding tax rate of 4.5 percent.


## Definition of “associate”
The following entities are regarded as ‘associates’ of a Hong Kong entity:
If the Hong Kong entity is a natural person:
  * Relatives of the person;
  * Partners of the person or the partners’ relatives;
  * Partnerships in which the person is a partner; or
  * Corporations are controlled by the person or directors of the controlled corporation.


If the Hong Kong entity is a corporation⟨10⟩:
  * Associated corporations that control the Hong Kong entity, under the Hong Kong entity’s control, or under the same control as the Hong Kong entity;
  * Individuals who control the Hong Kong entity, partners of the controller, or relatives of the controller or partner;
  * Directors of the Hong Kong entity (or any associated corporations), or relatives of the director; or
  * Partners of the corporation or relatives of the partner.


If the Hong Kong entity is a partnership:
  * All partners in the partnership or the partners’ relatives;
  * Corporations that are controlled by the partnership, or by a partner or any relative of a partner;
  * Directors of a controlled corporation; or
  * Corporations whose director is a partner in the Hong Kong partnership.


## Withholding tax for service fees
Service charges paid to non-residents who provide performances (such as entertainers and sportsmen) are subject to withholding tax in Hong Kong. The taxable performance service fees include:
  * A performance at a commercial event or occasion in Hong Kong, or
  * Any participation in sound recordings, films, videos, radio transmissions, and television broadcasts (whether live or recorded).


The nature of the contracts signed determines the rate:
  * For contracts made directly between a non-resident performer and the organizer, the rate is set at 10 percent.
  * For contracts between a non-resident third-party agent and the organization, a withholding tax rate of 10 percent applies if the agent is an individual, and a withholding tax rate of 11 percent applies if the agent is a corporation.


## Withholding tax rates
Here are the Hong Kong withholding tax rates for different payment categories:
Categories |  Payment types |  Rates  
---|---|---  
Royalty Payments |  Non-resident companies associates |  16.5 percent  
Royalty Payments |  Companies that are not residents and are not affiliated |  4.95 percent  
Royalty Payments |  Non-residents associates |  15 percent  
Royalty Payments |  Non-residents who are not associates |  4.5 percent  
Entertainers or Sportsmen |  Directly with non-resident entertainers or sportsmen |  10 percent  
Entertainers or Sportsmen |  Via a non-resident individual or partnership agent |  10 percent  
Entertainers or Sportsmen |  via non-resident company agents |  11 percent  
Dividends and Interest |  Not Applicable |  Not Applicable  
## Double tax treaties
Double tax treaties⟨9⟩ may offset taxes withheld if the jurisdiction has one with Hong Kong. However, as Hong Kong does not impose any dividend tax, these treaties generally do not apply to dividend payments. Hong Kong has so far entered 45 treaties with different jurisdictions, and withholding tax rates vary by treaty and jurisdiction. In most situations, the rate is between 2.475 percent and 4.95 percent.

# Navigating Hong Kong’s ESG: Regulations, Trends, and Opportunities

**_Hong Kong, positioned at the crossroads of finance and sustainability, emerges as a key player in the global ESG landscape. With robust regulatory frameworks, strategic green finance initiatives, and a surge in demand for ESG expertise, Hong Kong offers a vibrant ecosystem for sustainable finance._**

[promote-webinar url="https://www.dezshira.com/events/details/enhancing-your-accounting-capability-ai-introduction-xero-smes.html"]
Nestled in the heart of Asia, Hong Kong emerges as a vibrant financial powerhouse, uniquely positioned to propel sustainable finance and serve as the gateway to an unparalleled multi-trillion-dollar green investment opportunity in Mainland China. 
With a robust corporate governance framework and progressive Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) requirements, Hong Kong is leading the charge in fostering a sustainable ecosystem. 
In this article we highlight the regulatory landscape, emerging trends, and burgeoning opportunities within Hong Kong's dynamic ESG environment, providing insights into the city's financial prowess and commitment to sustainability. 
## Background
Hong Kong has established its climate objectives in alignment with global initiatives such as the Paris Agreement and the Central People’s Government’s **decarbonization agenda**⟨70⟩. 
In January 2017, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government unveiled the

In November 2020, the Chief Executive 
This robust commitment positions Hong Kong as a proactive player in the global ESG landscape, offering a foundation for exploring the vast opportunities within the city's evolving ESG framework. 
## Hong Kong's ESG regulatory framework
The existing regulatory framework for ESG in Hong Kong primarily targets listed companies, banks, and asset managers. 
Listed companies in Hong Kong are obligated to report on various aspects of ESG – environmental, social, and governance – predominantly following a comply-or-explain approach. Additionally, initial measures have been initiated by financial regulators to mandate banks and specific asset managers to address climate-related risks and disclose their climate-related initiatives. 
Hong Kong regulatory bodies have also actively communicated upcoming ESG regulatory developments to the market. On May 27, 2022, Ashley Alder, the CEO of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and chairman of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), 
Similarly, the 
Another significant development is exemplified by the recent 
### ESG reporting in Hong Kong: key requirements
The region's regulatory framework, spearheaded by institutions such as the HKEX and the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), outlines specific rules and requirements for ESG disclosure. The table below provides a concise overview of the key focus areas and compliance mechanisms established by each regulatory body.  **Key ESG Reporting Rules and Requirements in Hong Kong**  
---  
**Regulatory Body** | **Reporting Rules and Requirements** | **Focus Area** | **Compliance Mechanism**  
HKEX (Hong Kong Stock Exchange) | In 2016, introduced the requirement for listed companies to publish annual ESG reports, upgraded in 2020 and 2022. Requires specified mandatory disclosures and other comply or explain disclosures. The ESG reporting requirements are outlined in the "ESG Reporting Guide" in Appendix 27 of the Main Board Listing Rules and Appendix 20 to the GEM Listing Rules. | 
  * ESG management approach
  * Progress toward ESG-related targets

| 
  * Mandatory disclosure requirements (Part B of the ESG Reporting Guide)
  * "Comply or explain" provision for deviations or failures (Part C of the ESG Reporting Guide)

  
SFC (Securities and Futures Commission) | Separate from HKEX, implemented ESG requirements for SFC-authorized unit trusts and mutual funds focusing on ESG factors. Guidance on ESG disclosure is provided for these funds. | 
  * Key investment focus on ESG factors
  * Use of ESG investment risks and opportunities as a primary objective or strategy

| Guidance on ESG disclosure for SFC-authorized unit trusts and mutual funds  
Hong Kong's Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (BSAP) | BSAP is an action plan to enhance biodiversity conservation and support sustainable development. While it does not institute formal ESG reporting obligations, organizations and funds in Hong Kong may consider including biodiversity reporting in their ESG disclosure. | 
  * Biodiversity conservation
  * Sustainable development

| N/A (BSAP does not impose formal ESG reporting obligations)  
The latest directives, particularly those from the HKEX, emphasize the following three key areas: 
  * **Strengthening the board’s responsibility:** Hong Kong's ESG reporting framework places a significant responsibility on board members. By assigning boards the oversight of ESG disclosures, the framework underscores the pivotal role of leadership in the process. This approach also facilitates the allocation of resources for effective ESG implementation.
  * **Improving ESG management:** Hong Kong's ESG reporting stands out by focusing on future-oriented issues. Companies are required to anticipate sustainability challenges and proactively devise strategies to address them. This forward-looking approach ensures that investors and customers can evaluate disclosures to identify brands committed to responsible and sustainable practices.
  * **Promoting integration between companies and shareholders:** ESG sustainability reporting is regarded as a valuable tool to enhance stakeholder engagement. By involving stakeholders in the materiality assessment and key opportunities and risks review, companies can strengthen connections and create a more transparent and responsible image.


  * **Board and ESG Working Group:** Start the ESG reporting process with the board of directors commissioning the initiative.
  * **Reporting assessment:** Review the company’s processes and conduct a materiality assessment to identify reporting topics.
  * **Drawing ESG reporting strategy:** Define objectives based on selected reporting topics and craft a comprehensive strategy, addressing both current and anticipated challenges.
  * **Writing the report:** Generate the sustainability report, presenting it to stakeholders clearly and comprehensively.

With Hong Kong regulators gearing towards mandatory Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) reporting by 2025, it's imperative for companies, particularly those listed on HKEX, to conduct comprehensive assessments against TCFD recommendations. The recently issued HKEX recommendations serve as a valuable resource for aligning reporting practices with TCFD principles. 
Simultaneously, anticipating the 
#### Strengthening consistency between financial and sustainability reporting
The SFC Speech highlights the need for auditors and Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) to focus on the relevance of sustainability disclosures to financial statements. 
Companies are encouraged to connect the two areas, ensuring that capital expenditures for emissions reduction or carbon offset purchases are reflected in financial statements. ISSB's proposals emphasize the importance of enhancing connectivity. ISSB mandates companies to explain linkages, use consistent assumptions, and publish financial statements and sustainability disclosures simultaneously, covering the same reporting period and entity. 
#### Collaboration at all organizational levels
Action and collaboration are encouraged at all levels within corporate organizations. Boards are urged to integrate climate risks and opportunities into their strategic decision-making processes, actively monitoring progress toward set targets. Collaboration between sustainability, finance, and communications teams is crucial. 
## Sector-specific opportunities: green and sustainable finance
Hong Kong stands out as a thriving hub for **green and sustainable finance⟨71⟩** , experiencing remarkable growth in its debt market. Diving into the diverse product offerings, Hong Kong showcases a dynamic range of green investment products, including green bonds, sustainability bonds, social bonds, and sustainability-linked bonds. 
The robust performance of green and sustainable finance (GSF) in Hong Kong's debt market underscores its resilience and significance. In 2022, the SAR played a pivotal role in the Asian GSF landscape, arranging green and sustainable bonds totaling US$27.8 billion, constituting 35 percent of the regional market. Notably, amidst an overall decline in bond issuance, the GSF segment demonstrated resilience with only an 11 percent decrease in issuance. Private sector entities, particularly corporations beyond real estate and financial institutions, contributed significantly, accounting for around 90 percent of the total issuance. 
Beyond bonds, the flourishing realm of green and sustainable loans further propels Hong Kong's position as a dynamic hub for environmentally conscious financing, contributing to a total GSF debt volume of US$80.5 billion in 2022. 
### Government policies and incentives driving Hong Kong’s green bond market
The growing Hong Kong’s green bonds market. is intricately woven into the proactive policies and strategic initiatives undertaken by key entities, notably the HKSAR Government and the Green Bond Programme (GGBP), as illustrated in the table below.  **Policies and Incentives Driving Market for Green Bonds in Hong Kong**  
---  
**Entity/Initiatives** | **Key Contributions**  
HKSAR Government | 
  * As of July 31, 2022, the HKSAR government has issued nearly US$10 billion in green bonds under the Green Bond Programme (GGBP).
  * The proceeds from the green bonds are allocated to the Capital Works Reserve Fund, which saw an expanded scope and borrowing ceiling of HK$200 billion (US$25.6 billion) in July 2021. This expansion allows funding for a broader range of green projects, including public works projects.
  * In January 2023, a successful offering of US$5.75 billion worth of green bonds marked the first triple-currency offering in Asia, making it the largest ESG bond issuance in the region. The issuance attracted over US$36 billion equivalent in orders, showcasing strong global institutional investor demand.

  
Green Bond Programme (GGBP) | 
  * The GGBP is a pivotal component of the government's efforts to foster green finance.
  * The program aims to align regulatory standards with international best practices, particularly those established by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA).

  
## Demand for ESG roles and skills in Hong Kong
Fueled by an escalating focus on sustainability across the corporate spectrum and mirroring a wider global shift towards responsible business practices, Hong Kong

To meet the demand for ESG expertise, companies in Hong Kong are looking to attract top-tier talent. Offering salary premiums exceeding 30 percent, these businesses are aligning their recruitment strategies with sustainability goals. This approach reflects a commitment to environmental and social responsibility while positioning Hong Kong as a hub for ESG professionals. 
Amidst this trend, there's a heightened demand for expertise in key areas such as ESG reporting, climate change, and carbon emissions. 
Moreover, the surge in demand for ESG expertise is notably pronounced in the financial sector, with a particular emphasis on green finance professionals. Institutions in Hong Kong, especially banks and investment funds committed to sustainability investing, are actively seeking and prioritizing the right ESG talent to meet the evolving needs of the industry. 
## What makes Hong Kong a strategic hub for ESG opportunities
Hong Kong's firm commitment to climate goals positions it as a crucial hub for ESG opportunities in the region. 
As Asia's premier international financial center, Hong Kong plays a pivotal role in green and sustainable finance, offering economic growth opportunities and contributing significantly to climate change mitigation. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority's (HKMA) initiative to develop a green classification system aligns with international standards, minimizing greenwashing risks and ensuring conformity with global ESG frameworks. Notably, the focus on integrating resilience into green investments acknowledges Hong Kong's susceptibility to extreme weather events, reflecting a comprehensive approach to ESG considerations. 
While being a gateway to China, Hong Kong is strategically positioned to harness the green finance prospects emerging from the advancement of the **Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area**⟨72⟩ and China's Belt and Road Initiative.

# Salaries Tax in Hong Kong
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/taxation-and-accounting/individual-income-tax)
Individuals pay income tax on their earnings, with rates ranging from two percent to a maximum of 17 percent after deductions and allowances or 15 percent on net income after deductions. 
  

Contributing Advisor
## Taxable income
Taxable income includes various forms of compensation, such as: 
  * Allowances;
  * Bonuses;
  * Commissions;
  * Salaries; and,
  * Company benefits. 


Hong Kong does not tax dividends, interest, or capital gains for individuals. However, the SAR has specific income tax categories:
  * Profits tax⟨25⟩ for business profits;
  * Salaries tax for employment income, office income, or pensions; and,
  * Property tax⟨26⟩ for rental income from property. 


An individual's residency status is typically not the sole factor for salaries tax liability unless it relates to a tax treaty.
## Employment income taxation
Employment⟨20⟩ income taxation is straightforward and taxpayer-friendly⟨3⟩. The city follows a territorial taxation system, meaning only income earned within Hong Kong is subject to tax.
### Employment income scope
Salaries tax is primarily applicable to individuals in an employment relationship. It covers both local and expatriate employees.
The Hong Kong Inland Revenue Department (HKIRD) will generally accept that employment is non-Hong Kong employment if all the following three conditions are met:
  * The employment contract was negotiated and entered and is enforceable outside Hong Kong SAR.
  * The employer is a resident outside Hong Kong SAR.
  * The employee’s remuneration is paid outside Hong Kong SAR.


If any of the above conditions are not met, the employment will likely be considered by the HKIRD as Hong Kong employment.
For Hong Kong employment, income is tax-free if all employment services in a tax year are performed outside of Hong Kong SAR. Services provided within Hong Kong SAR for less than 60 days during the assessment year (known as the '60-day rule') are not counted.
For non-Hong Kong employment, only income related to services within Hong Kong SAR is subject to Hong Kong salaries tax, following the 'time apportionment basis.' The 60-day rule also applies here, meaning services performed within Hong Kong SAR for up to 60 days during the assessment year are disregarded.
  * Salaries⟨36⟩, Wages, and Director's fees;
  * Commissions, Bonuses, Leave Pay⟨35⟩, Contract Gratuities, and Payments in place of Notice accrued on or after 1 April 2012;
  * Allowances, Perquisites, and Fringe Benefits;
  * Tips;
  * Salaries Tax Paid by Employer;
  * Value of a Place of Residence;
  * Stock Awards and Share Options;
  * Back Pay, Gratuities, Deferred Pay, and Pay in Debts
  * Termination Payments⟨23⟩ and Retirement Benefits⟨37⟩; and,


#### Non-chargeable income include:
  * Severance Payments and Long Service Payments; and,
  * Jury Fees.


### Deductions
Expenses that qualify for deduction under salaries tax are limited to those directly related to generating income subject to salaries tax, excluding domestic, personal, or capital expenses. Meeting the strict criteria of being wholly, exclusively, and unavoidably incurred for income production is a rare occurrence in practice.
Deductions (Maximum Limits) - Year of assessment 2024/25 onwards  
---  
Expenses of self-education |  HK$100,000 (US$12,787)  
Elderly residential care expense |  HK$100,000 (US$12,787)  
Home loan interest Additional |  HK$100,000 (US$12,787) HK$20,000  
Mandatory contribution to recognized retirement schemes |  HK$18,000 (US$2,301)  
Approved charitable donations (income - allowable expenses- depreciation allowance) x percentage |  35%  
Qualifying premiums paid under Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme (VHIS) policy (for each insured person) |  HK$8,000 (US$1,000)  
Qualifying annuity premiums and tax-deductible MPF voluntary contributions |  HK$60,000 (US$7,600)  
Domestic rent deduction* Additional |  HK$100,000 (US$12,787) HK$20,000  
Expenses on Assisted Reproductive Services* |  HK$100,000  
*Legislative amendments are required for implementing the tax measures.  
## Deductible employment costs
Certain work-related travel and entertainment expenses (excluding personal commuting expenses like from home to the workplace) may be eligible for deductions under income tax, provided they meet the specified criteria mentioned earlier. Depreciation allowances may be allowed on capital expenditure incurred on plant and machinery, which is essential in the production of assessable income.
## Tax rates and calculations
The Budget 2024-25 will implement a new two-tiered tax rate regime for salaries and personal assessment tax from the 2024 to 2025 assessment year onward. 
Under the two-tiered system, taxpayers with net income exceeding HK$5 million (US$638,630) would see a 16 percent standard rate applied to the portion exceeding HK$5 million. This would affect around 12,000 taxpayers, boosting government revenue by approximately HK$910 million (US$116.23 million) annually. Under the previous system, the rate was capped at 15 percent.
All individuals earning income from or derived from Hong Kong from an office, employment, or pension are subject to salaries tax in Hong Kong.
Tax payable is calculated at a progressive rate on the “net chargeable income” or a standard rate on the “net income” (before deduction of the allowances), depending on which is lower. The tax reduction, subject to a maximum, further reduces it.
_Net Chargeable Income = Total Income – Deductions – Allowances_
_Net Income = Total Income – Deductions_
Tax Rates

## Provisional salaries tax
Salaries tax is chargeable on the assessable income for each year of assessment.
As the assessable income for any particular year cannot be known until after the end of the year concerned, a provisional tax charge must be raised. When the assessable income for the year of assessment is subsequently ascertained, an assessment will be made, and the provisional salaries tax paid will be utilized to offset the tax liability under the assessment.
The taxpayer can apply in writing for holding over the whole or part of the provisional salaries tax on the grounds specified in the Inland Revenue Ordinance.
### Application grounds
You can request an extension of your provisional salaries tax payment for several reasons:
  * You can request a holdover if you've become eligible for an additional allowance not initially considered in your provisional tax, like child or dependent parent allowance. For a successful application, include essential details such as the child's name and birthdate or the dependent parent's name, birthdate, and Hong Kong Identity Card number, along with proof of their Hong Kong residency in the relevant year.
  * In case your net chargeable income for the assessment year, for which provisional tax is due, is expected to be **less than 90 percent** of your net chargeable income for the preceding year or the estimated sum you're liable to pay as provisional tax; you can apply for a holdover.
  * You can apply for a holdover if you pay or expect to pay substantial expenses such as self-education, retirement scheme contributions, home loan interest, and more during the assessment year while being subject to provisional salaries tax, and these expenses surpass the previous year's threshold.
  * If you've stopped earning income subject to salaries tax or plan to cease this income before the end of the assessment year for which provisional tax was assessed, you can apply for a holdover. It would help to estimate your income for the entire assessment year in your application. For example, if you want to delay provisional tax payment for 2023/24, include your estimated income **from April 1, 2023, to March 31, 2024** , and explain the reasons for the income reduction, such as unemployment, retirement, or salaries reductions.
  * Finally, suppose you've raised objections against your salaries tax assessment for the previous year preceding the assessment year for which provisional tax was levied. In that case, you can also apply for a holdover of your provisional tax payment.


###  Application time limit
Your application for holding over of provisional tax should be lodged no later than:
  * 28 days before the due date for payment of the provisional tax or
  * 14 days after the date of issue of the notice for payment of the provisional tax, whichever is later.


If the provisional tax is payable in two installments and the first installment has been settled by the due date, an application for holding over the whole or part of the second installment may be made subject to the prescribed time limit and grounds for the application.
### Employer obligation
The employer must inform the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) within three months if it anticipates the employee will likely be charged to salaries tax. The employer also needs to file the Employer’s Return one month before the termination date when an employee is terminated and file the Employer’s Return one month before the expected departure date for employees leaving Hong Kong permanently or for a substantial period.
In addition, any post-departure payments (e.g., bonuses, option gain, share awards, tax equalization settlements) paid to an employee after their departure regarding the employee’s employment/assignment/secondment in Hong Kong shall be subject to Hong Kong’s salaries tax. As such, the employer must report the relevant post-departure payments (if any) to the IRD accordingly.

### Employee obligation
Employees are also legally responsible for the Annual Tax Return to the Inland Revenue Department.

If the employee receives an individual tax return from the Inland Revenue Department, they must complete and submit it by the due date for filing, even if they have no income that can be charged to salaries tax. The reporting should include total income, allowance, deductions, etc.
If the employee doesn’t receive a tax return, they should notify the Inland Revenue Department that the income could be taxable.
The Inland Revenue Department will evaluate the employee’s situation and decide on a tax rate that the employee must pay for the past tax period **(from April 1 each year to March 31 of next year).**
## Case study
From 1st Oct 2023, the subject’s monthly salary is HK$45,000 (US$5,100), and MPF contribution is HK$1,500 (US$191). The financial year is April 1 to March 31 of the following year. Tax is filed and paid on an annual base. No pre-deductions were required. Then, how do we calculate the subject’s salaries tax for the year of assessment 2023/24 under the progressive rate and standard rate?
###  1. Under progressive tax rate 
Year of assessment 2023/24 |  HK$  
---|---  
Income: 6 months |  45,000 × 6 = 270,000 (US$34,500)  
First deduction: MPF contribution |  1,500×6 = 9,000 (US$1,150)  
Second deduction: Basic allowance |  132,000 (US$16,800)  
Net chargeable Income |  270,000 - 9,000 - 132,000 = 129,000 (US$16,500)  
Tax payable (before reduction) *: |  50,000 × 2% + 50,000 × 6% + 29,000 × 10% = 6,900 (US$882)  
Tax reduction for 2023/24: 100% tax-exempt (Max.3,000) |  3,000 (US$384)  
Tax payable(after reduction): |  6,900 - 3,000 = 3,900  
_*For the year of assessment 2023/24, the first HK$50,000 (US$6,300)__net chargeable income is subject to a tax rate of 2%, the second HK$50,000 (US$6,300)__is subject to a tax rate of 6%, and the third HK$50,000 (US$6,300)__is subject to a tax rate of 10%._  
### 2. Under standard tax rate
Year of assessment 2023/24 |  HK$  
---|---  
Income: 6 months |  45,000 × 6 = 270,000  
First Deduction: MPF contribution |  1,500×6 = 9,000  
Net income: |  270,000 - 9,000 = 261,000  
Tax payable (before deduction) |  261,000 × 15% = 39.150  
Tax reduction for 2023/24: 100% tax-exempt (Max.3,000) |  39,150 × 100% = 39,150 > 3,000  
Tax payable (after reduction): |  39,150 - 3,000 = 36,150  
Through the comparison, the employee should better use a progressive tax rate to calculate the annual tax, and the tax amount is shown in the above table.
Also, in practice, there are some other deductible-related considerations:
  * Family status (spouse income status, children or dependents);
  * Residential status;
  * Foreign staff (no need to pay MPF in the first 12 months);
  * Home loan interests;
  * Loss from other personal business; and
  * Double tax treaties.


### Maximum tax reductions
Salaries tax for the 2023/24 assessment year is further reduced by a one-off tax reduction of 100 percent, subject to a ceiling of HK$3,000 (US$384) per case. For single taxpayers, the ceiling is applied to each individual; for couples jointly assessed, the ceiling is applied to each married couple (that is, capped at HK$3,000 in total). Married individuals may elect personal assessment separately to reduce tax liability.
Did You Know
The tax reduction will only apply to the final tax for the year of assessment 2023/24 but not to the provisional tax of the same year. Therefore, taxpayers must still pay their provisional tax on time despite the reduction measure.
### Tax reduction for domestic rental expenses
The Hong Kong 2022-23 Budget proposed a tax reduction for domestic rental expenses starting from the year of assessment 2022/23, subject to a ceiling of HK$100,000 (US$12,700) for a year of assessment. This is to ease the burden of renting a private property on taxpayers liable to salaries tax and tax under personal assessment who are not owners of domestic properties. This measure will be affected by amending the Inland Revenue Ordinance.
Further information supplemented by the IRD is noted in the table below:
Proposed Tax Reduction for Domestic Rental Expenses  
---  
Eligible persons |  Who is eligible:
  * Taxpayers are liable to salaries tax and tax charged under personal assessment
  * Deduction is also allowed to a taxpayer in respect of a tenancy agreement entered into by his/her co-habiting spouse

  
Who is not eligible:
  * Taxpayer who owns any domestic property
  * Landlord of the rented property is an associate of the taxpayer (e.g., the landlord is a spouse, parent, child, brother/sister or partner of the taxpayer, or a corporation controlled by the taxpayer)
  * Taxpayer who is provided with a place of residence by his/her employer (including those who receive a refund for any rent paid)

  
Eligible rented properties |  What is eligible:
  * The rented private property must be the taxpayer’s principal place of residence in Hong Kong
  * With a stamped tenancy agreement

  
What is not eligible:
  * Premises in respect of which letting for domestic purposes is not permitted (e.g., the rented private property is a non-domestic property)
  * Domestic property rented under a lease-purchase agreement

  
Allowable deduction amount | 
  * Deduction ceiling: HK$100,000 (US$12,700) for each year of assessment (no limit for entitlement period)
  * A deduction is only allowed for rental expenses already paid
  * If there is more than 1 tenant under the tenancy agreement, the deduction ceiling is to be reduced in proportion to the number of co-tenants of the tenancy agreement
  * If the tenancy period falling within a year of assessment is less than 12 months, the deduction ceiling is to be reduced in proportion to the relevant tenancy period within the year of assessment

## Capital gains tax
Any profits made by an individual from capital gains are exempt from taxation in Hong Kong.
However, although Hong Kong does not impose a capital gains tax, profits earned from selling assets within the SAR may be regarded as trading gains and are subject to taxation under profits tax. 
  * Resident individuals who receive royalties from Hong Kong sources are also taxable on these amounts as business profits under profits tax. 
  * Non-resident individuals who receive royalties may be subject to withholding tax if the intellectual property associated with the royalties is used within Hong Kong or if the use occurs outside the SAR. However, the royalties paid are deductible under profits tax by the payer.


## Inheritance tax or estate duty
The inheritance tax has been eliminated in Hong Kong. This condition means that when a person passes away, their assets can be transferred to their beneficiaries without tax obligations. Furthermore, certain taxes that are typically applicable are exempted upon death. 
There is an exemption on stamp duty for property and stock transfers due to inheritance, which typically applies to transfers during the person's lifetime. It provides reassurance regarding the treatment of your assets after your passing. 
Estate duty is charged on the total value of property located in Hong Kong that is transferred or deemed to be transferred in connection with a person's death, based on a progressive scale of rates determined by the date of the deceased's death. For transitional estates, the duty amount is set at **US$100**.
The term "passes" refers to the transfer of beneficial ownership, possession, or enjoyment of property from one person to another due to the former's death.
Properties subject to estate duty include:
  * All assets owned by the deceased
  * The deceased's portion of jointly owned property
  * Property that the deceased gave away within the three years preceding their death. 


The recipients of these gifts are responsible for paying the duty.
Even if ownership of jointly owned property automatically transfers to the surviving joint owner upon the death of another joint owner, estate duty is still applicable. Therefore, the surviving joint owner must submit an Account for the Commissioner (IRED 12) to settle the estate duty for the jointly owned properties before obtaining clearance.

# Why Invest in Hong Kong
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/why-hong-kong)
A highly dynamic international city, Hong Kong serves as a primary gateway to Mainland China and Asia and a hub for global and regional business, helping to make it one of the most competitive and top international cities for companies, investors, and professionals.
  

Contributing Advisor
In this guide, we discuss why Hong Kong is a hotbed for companies looking to leverage market advantages such as:
  * An open, fair, and efficient business environment⟨70⟩
  * Competitive tax regime⟨71⟩
  * Excellent legal and dispute resolution services under the rule of law⟨72⟩
  * Closer proximity to markets in Asia, including mainland China⟨73⟩
  * Leading global financial services center⟨74⟩
  * Network of international free trade and tax agreements⟨75⟩
  * World-class infrastructure with sophisticated support services⟨76⟩
  * Highly skilled and multicultural talent pool and a liberal Immigration policy⟨77⟩


## Efficient business landscape
Hong Kong’s economic system is defined as a free-market economy characterized by minimum intervention from the government, low taxation, free port trade, and a highly internationalized and modernized financial market.
The city’s service-oriented economy (with services accounting for more than 90 percent of its GDP) is especially powerful in financial services, international trade, and tourism. Additionally, it has strong economic links to mainland China and other major economies in the Asia Pacific region.

As one of the most Laissez-faire economies in the world, the government’s policy is strictly non-interventionist.
The absence of exchange controls, corruption-free government, and free flow of information, capital, and talents has enabled Hong Kong to maintain a free and efficient business environment for business activities and commerce.
In addition, Hong Kong enjoys a strong reputation as a "free port" with streamlined customs clearance processes. The city imposes no tariffs on imported goods, has no import quotas, and applies excise duties to only four specific commodities: hard alcohol, tobacco, oil, and methyl alcohol.

## Competitive tax regime
Businesses and individuals enjoy one of the most tax-friendly systems⟨23⟩ in the world.
Hong Kong imposes only three kinds of direct taxes – profits tax⟨24⟩ (for incorporated bodies), salaries tax⟨29⟩ (for personal income), and property tax⟨25⟩ (for income sources from Hong Kong property).
Did You Know
Unlike many other jurisdictions, Hong Kong adopts a territorial basis of taxation, i.e., only income sources from Hong Kong are taxable.
There are also generous allowances and deductions, which can reduce the taxable amount.
  * The profits tax rate for corporations is 16.5 percent on profits exceeding HK$2 million (US$255,000). For the first HK$2 million, a two-tiered rate applies: 8.25 percent for the first HK$2 million and 16.5 percent for profits above that.
  * For unincorporated businesses (e., partnerships and sole proprietorships), the two-tiered profits tax rates are set at 7.5 percent and 15 percent. 
  * The standard rate is 15 percent, but a new two-tiered system has been proposed where the first HK$5 million (US$643,434) of net income will be taxed at 15 percent, and any amount above that at 16 percent starting from the 2024/25 assessment year.
  * 15 percent property tax.


Hong Kong has no turnover taxes (like value-added or sales tax), making it a favorable location for profit shifting and re-invoicing.

## Legal and dispute resolution services
Hong Kong is home to some 850 local solicitor firms and more than 70 global law firms. Legal advisors based in Hong Kong are familiar with different countries' legal and regulatory landscape worldwide. Benefiting from a sound and independent legal system, Hong Kong has long been a regional hub for dispute resolution, with the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre rated the most preferred seat of arbitration outside Europe.
Due to its previous status as a British colony, Hong Kong’s legal system is influenced by English common law. The constitutional framework for its legal system is provided by the Basic Law approved by the National People’s Congress, which supplements the common law.
The independent judiciary under the Basic Law ensures that Hong Kong remains within the common law system. The Court of Final Appeal is the highest in HKSAR and is headed by the Chief Justice. Furthermore, reflecting its status as a Special Administrative Region, the HKSAR legal system is separated from the one governing the PRC under the principle of “One Country, Two Systems.”
## Proximity to mainland China, Asian markets
Hong Kong enjoys an ideal location in Asia that enables businesses to tap into the various opportunities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao GBA⟨78⟩ and throughout the rest of the region.
Hong Kong and Mainland China signed the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) in 2003. This agreement facilitates easier access to the vast mainland market for Hong Kong products and services. It goes beyond China's commitments under the World Trade Organization (WTO), as it eliminates tariffs and grants earlier or preferential access to certain service sectors.
Overseas companies can also reap the benefits of CEPA. In terms of trade in goods, foreign investors can establish production lines in Hong Kong to manufacture goods that meet CEPA's rules of origin (ROO) requirements. For trade-in services, companies incorporated in Hong Kong by foreign investors can utilize CEPA, provided they meet the eligibility criteria of a "Hong Kong Service Supplier."
Additionally, unveiling the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) outline in 2019 further strengthens the ties between Hong Kong and the mainland.
The Guangdong-Macao-Hong Kong Greater Bay Area (GBA) is a mega-city cluster located in the Pearl River Delta comprised of nine cities in the south of Guangdong province and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macao. The nine Guangdong cities include some of the largest and most economically active cities on the Chinese mainland, such as Guangzhou and Shenzhen's manufacturing and technology powerhouses. Hong Kong’s inclusion in the GBA provides streamlined access for Hong Kong and international investors to invest in Mainland China.
## Leading financial services center
As one of the leading international financial centers, Hong Kong is a prime location for financial services and home to many financial institutions. Its financial markets operate under effective and transparent regulations that align with international standards.
Located at the heart of Asia, Hong Kong thrives on close financial integration with Mainland China, extensive networks with the rest of the world, a sound legal system, a low and simple tax regime, a free flow of capital, and a large pool of financial talents.
Looking forward, with new opportunities arising from the Greater Bay Area Outline Development Plan (GBA Outline), the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), fintech, infrastructure investments and financing, and green finance, Hong Kong’s status as a leading financial hub is expected to be further strengthened.
  * **Unique access channels to and from China:** Hong Kong and Mainland China have made remarkable progress in opening new channels to enhance their financial connectivity. Examples of this are the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII), Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII), Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect and Bond Connect, Mainland-Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds arrangement, and the most recent two-way cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect in the GBA.
  * **Largest offshore RMB center:** Offers a wide range of RMB financial services, including clearing and settlement, financing, asset management, risk management, etc. The highly efficient and robust market infrastructure in Hong Kong, including the RMB Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system, allows market participants from around the world to handle RMB transactions with Mainland China and among offshore markets.
  * **Banking hub:** Hong Kong is Asia's most prominent banking hub for Chinese and international banks, with various initiatives to harness rapid technological advancements to move Hong Kong into a new era of Smart Banking.
  * **Corporate Treasury Center (CTCs):** Being an international financial center with a full range of services, Hong Kong has been an ideal hub for corporate treasury activities. The government has also introduced tax incentives to encourage more corporations to set up their CTCs in Hong Kong.
  * **Capital market:** Hong Kong’s highly liberal, liquid, and deep securities market has attracted many international banks and securities houses to build their presence here, providing another critical channel for companies to raise funds in the form of equity and debt.
  * **Asset management:** Hong Kong is a hub for fund management, private wealth management, hedge funds, and private equity. Specifically, Hong Kong is the largest international asset management hub in Asia. It is also Asia’s largest global private wealth management and hedge fund center and the second-largest private equity center after China.
  * **Fintech hub** : Hong Kong is dedicated to building itself as a fintech hub in Asia. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority promotes fintech development via Smart Banking Initiatives, the “Fintech 2025⟨79⟩” strategy.
  * **Infrastructure investments:** Hong Kong, an international financial center and China’s global financial center, is uniquely positioned to facilitate the linkage between the significant funding needs of infrastructure projects, especially in emerging market economies, and the vast pool of global capital that seeks to invest.
  * **Green finance:** Having a deep, liquid bond market, Hong Kong is well-positioned to grasp the opportunities brought about by green and sustainable finance. Several initiatives have been launched to promote the development of the green bond market, including the Government Green Bond Program and the Green and Sustainable Finance Grant Scheme.


## Free trade and tax agreements network
Hong Kong has been actively seeking to expand its Free Trade Agreement (FTA)⟨7⟩ and Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement Network⟨8⟩ to secure favorable conditions for businesses operating in the SAR.
### Free trade agreements
So far, Hong Kong has signed eight FTAs, respectively with
  * The Mainland of China (June 2003)⟨80⟩;
  * New Zealand (March 2010)⟨81⟩;
  * The Member States of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) (June 2011)⟨82⟩;
  * Chile (September 2012)⟨83⟩;
  * Macau (October 2017)⟨84⟩;
  * The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) (November 2017)⟨85⟩;
  * Australia (March 2019)⟨86⟩; and


It has also concluded the FTA negotiation with the Maldives (yet to be notified to the WTO).

### Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements
Hong Kong has signed comprehensive DTAs with 51 countries and is negotiating agreements with 17 others. The DTAs specify the tax rates for dividends, interest, royalties, and technical fees these countries can charge Hong Kong residents. The methods for eliminating double taxation are outlined in each DTA or the other country's domestic law, with the tax credit method being the most common.

Hong Kong's Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) network provides a mechanism to mitigate the challenge of double taxation faced by global investors. Hong Kong follows a territoriality-based taxation system, taxing only income sourced within the SAR, thus avoiding double taxation for its residents.
Additionally, Hong Kong offers unilateral tax credit relief to its residents who operate businesses in other countries, ensuring they avoid issues with double taxation.
To further reduce tax burdens for companies, the Advance Pricing Arrangement (APA) program allows taxpayers to engage transparently with tax authorities to determine appropriate criteria for pricing-related party transactions over a fixed period.

## World-class infrastructure and support services
Hong Kong provides some of the most advanced business infrastructure in the world. The city is easily accessible with one of the world’s most efficient and affordable public transport systems.
The multi-award-winning Hong Kong International Airport is the world’s busiest cargo gateway and one of the busiest passenger airports. The Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link runs from the terminus at Hong Kong West Kowloon Station to the Shenzhen boundary in 14 minutes, shortening the time to Guangzhou to 46 minutes. The 55 km-long Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge is the longest sea-crossing bridge in the world. It connects Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao and brings the Western Pearl River Delta region within a three-hour drive of Hong Kong.
## Highly skilled talent and liberal immigration policies
Hong Kong has a diverse talent pool equipped with the skills and knowledge to drive business in Hong Kong and beyond. The city is home to 22 degree-awarding higher education institutions⟨87⟩. Four Hong Kong universities are featured in the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings top 100 list. Many business professionals here are bilingual or trilingual, mostly speaking English, Cantonese, and Mandarin.
Further, Hong Kong has all along adopted an open immigration policy. About 170 countries and territories are allowed visa-free visits to Hong Kong⟨34⟩ from 7 to 180 days.

## Auditing and assurance standards
The established guidelines for auditing and assurance in Hong Kong are referred to as the "Hong Kong Standards on Quality Control/Management, Auditing, Assurance, and Related Services."
The introduction to these standards⟨70⟩ outlines the Institute Council's objectives and the prescribed procedures concerning the Hong Kong Standards on Quality Control/Management, Auditing, Assurance, and Related Services.
The term "Hong Kong standards on quality control, auditing, assurance, and related services" includes:
Standards |  Descriptions  
---|---  
Hong Kong standards on quality control/management (HKSQCs/HKSQMs) |  HKSQCs and HKSQMs establish fundamental principles and essential procedures while offering guidance on a firm's quality control and management responsibilities per Hong Kong engagement standards.  
Hong Kong framework for assurance engagements |  HKSAs, HKSREs, HKSAEs, HKSIRs, and HKSRSs are collectively referred to as the Hong Kong engagement standards.  
Hong Kong standards on auditing (HKSAs) |  HKSAs are used when auditing historical financial information.  
Hong Kong standards on review engagements (HKSREs) |  HKSREs are applied when reviewing historical financial information.  
Hong Kong standards on assurance engagements (HKSAEs) |  HKSAEs should be used in assurance engagements that involve subject matters other than historical financial information.  
Hong Kong standards on investment circular reporting engagements (HKSIRs) |  HKSIRs are utilized in engagements related to investment circular reporting.  
Hong Kong standards on related services (HKSRSs) |  HKSRSs are applied in compilation engagements, engagements for applying agreed-upon procedures to information, and other related service engagements.  
## Bookkeeping requirements
According to Part 9 of the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance, companies incorporated in Hong Kong must maintain proper books of accounts and satisfy statutory audit requirements annually.
To be more detailed, the bookkeeping requirements are as follows:
  * A company must keep accounting records that comply with:


  * Accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s transactions; to disclose the company’s financial position and performance with reasonable accuracy; and to enable directors to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Ordinance.
  * In particular, the accounting records must contain: 
    * Daily entries of all sums of money received and expended by the company, and the matters in respect of which the receipt and expenditure takes place; and,
    * The assets and liabilities of the company.


  * Where to keep the accounting records:


  * A company’s accounting records must be kept at its registered office or any other place that the directors think fit and must always be open to inspection by the directors without charge; and,
  * If a company’s accounting records are kept outside Hong Kong, the accounts and returns must be sent to a place within Hong Kong. Those accounts and returns must disclose with reasonable accuracy the financial position of the business in question at intervals of not more than six months.


  * How long accounting records are to be preserved:


  * The company must preserve the records for seven years after the end of the financial year in which the last entry was made.


  * Penalties for not complying with the bookkeeping requirements:


  * A company director who fails to take all reasonable steps to secure compliance with the bookkeeping requirements commits an offense and is liable to a fine of HK$300,000 (US$38,370).


## Financial reporting requirements
Statutory reports are required annually for companies incorporated in Hong Kong⟨11⟩. The reports must contain audited financial statements for the current year, with corresponding amounts for the preceding year, including a balance sheet, profit and loss account, and a cash flow statement. Audited financial statements must be prepared and signed off by a certified public accountant on behalf of a business or non-profit organization to provide financial accountability and accuracy to stakeholders and people with a vested interest in the company.
If a company is incorporated outside but has a place of business in Hong Kong, they should register as a foreign company with the Registry. If required to publish their financial statements under the laws or regulations of their incorporated place, the foreign company should file its financial statements in the annual return to the Registry.
Foreign companies whose securities are publicly traded in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange may prepare financial statements in accordance with either the HKFRS or the IFRS or under certain limited conditions of other reporting frameworks, such as the China Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises (ASBE) and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (US GAAP).
To prepare financial statements, certain documents might be required according to the instructions by the Inland Revenue Department. These are as follows:
Documents to be Maintained for Financial Statements by Type of Transaction  
---  
Type |  Record to be maintained  
Sales |  Sales invoice  
Goods return note  
Receipt slip  
Daily receipt record  
Purchases |  Purchases invoice  
Petty cash voucher  
Payment slip  
Check stub  
Statement  
General expenses |  Expenses invoice  
Payment receipt  
Check stub  
Salary record  
Bank transaction |  Bank statements  
Bank paid-in slip and related receipt details  
Check stub and copy  
Tangible assets |  Purchase and sale agreement  
Invoice and receipt  
Check stub and copy  
Inventory |  Purchase and sale agreement  
Invoice and receipt  
Check stub and copy  
Inventory list (including quantity and unit cost of every item)  
Obsolete or slowing-moving inventory  
Investment |  Security ask/bid confirmation slip  
Purchase and sale agreement  
Capital inspection report (apply for PRC investment)  
Note:   
## Auditing process
Auditors must be certified public accountants registered with HKICPA. The audit involves planning, testing, evaluating internal controls, analyzing results, and reporting.
### Steps in the Audit Process
  * **Planning**
    * Understand the company's business and risks.
    * Formulate an audit plan with scope, objectives, and procedures.
  * **Testing**
    * Obtain and evaluate audit evidence.
    * Test internal controls.
    * Verify the accuracy and completeness of financial information.
    * Conduct analytical procedures.
  * **Internal Controls Evaluation**
    * Assess the effectiveness of internal controls.
    * Test design and implementation.
    * Evaluate operating effectiveness.
  * **Analysis and Opinion**
    * Analyze audit results.
    * Issue an opinion on financial statements:
    * Unqualified (reliable).
    * Qualified (significant errors found).
    * Adverse (material misrepresentations).
  * **Reporting**
    * Report internal control deficiencies.
    * Help improve internal controls.


**Additional Steps**
  * Management prepares financial statements and supporting documents.
  * Auditors review company activities and industry factors.
  * Identify uncertainties or errors in significant transactions.
  * Estimate the steps taken to ensure accuracy.
  * Create audit reports and opinions.
  * Directors sign the audit report.
  * Auditors prepare tax computations and submit documents to the government.
  * IRD reviews audit reports and financial statements and sends tax schedules (if applicable).


The audit process requires time and effort. Prepare the required financial statements and documents to save time.
### What is an audit report?
An audit report is a document issued by an auditor after their examination of a company's financial records. It serves to communicate the auditor's findings and opinion regarding the accuracy and reliability of the financial statements. The primary purpose of the audit report is to assure stakeholders, such as shareholders, investors, and creditors, about the financial health and transparency of the audited entity.
There are two main types of audit reports:
  * **Unqualified Report (Clean Report):** An unqualified audit report is issued when the auditor concludes that the financial statements are free from material misstatements. In other words, the auditor has not identified any significant errors or irregularities that would impact the overall fairness and accuracy of the financial statements. An unqualified report is considered favorable and indicates that the financial statements provide a true and fair view of the company's financial position.
  * **Qualified Report:** A qualified audit report is issued when the auditor has identified certain issues or limitations in the financial statements. While the auditor believes the financial statements are generally accurate, there may be specific areas or transactions where material misstatements exist. The auditor will detail these concerns in the report, explaining the nature and extent of the issues that led to the qualification. A qualified report indicates that users of the financial statements should exercise caution and pay special attention to the qualified areas.


The audit report is critical for stakeholders as it provides an independent assessment of the company's financial statements and helps them make informed decisions about the entity's financial health and performance. 
The IRD mandates the inclusion of a third-party audit review of a company's accounts and financial statements in Hong Kong to prevent any inaccuracies or fraudulent audit reviews.
## Renewal of Business Registration Certificate
A local private limited company needs to renew the business registration one month before its expiry. The renewal can be done annually or once every three years, depending on whether the certificate is valid for one year or three years. The Business Registration Office of the Inland Revenue Department will send a renewal demand note to registered businesses approximately in the middle of the month preceding the commencement month of the renewal Business Registration Certificate.
## Holding an annual general meeting
Every company incorporated in Hong Kong must hold an annual general meeting (AGM) once per year. The AGM should be held within six months of their financial year-end, or within 18 months from the date of incorporation for newly registered businesses. Shareholders must receive at least 21 days’ notice before the AGM. Under the amended Companies Ordinance (Cap.622), companies can conduct AGMs virtually or in hybrid formats, making compliance with the AGM requirement more flexible and convenient.

# Hong Kong’s Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/why-hong-kong/hong-kong-s-double-taxation-avoidance-agreements)
Hong Kong has established Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs) with various nations to prevent double taxation and financial misconduct. These agreements promote cooperation with global tax authorities, impacting residents of Hong Kong and partner countries.
  

Contributing Advisor
Critical points of Hong Kong's DTAs:
  * Eliminate double taxation from overlapping tax jurisdictions.
  * Clarify tax rules for international transactions.⟨27⟩
  * Resolve conflicts over taxpayer residence and income source.
  * Provide avenues to address taxation issues.
  * Prevent income flow tax avoidance.
  * Enhance investment, trade, and personnel movement by reducing foreign withholding tax⟨30⟩ rates.


Double taxation occurs when income or profits are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions, leading to the same earnings being taxed more than once. Hong Kong residents do not face this issue and typically do not experience double taxation.
## Double taxation agreement network
Double taxation, where income or profits are taxed in multiple jurisdictions, can create complex financial burdens. However, Hong Kong has established a unique taxation framework known as the territoriality basis, where only income or profit generated within its borders is subject to taxation. Income derived from sources outside Hong Kong by residents is generally exempt from tax⟨26⟩. Therefore, Hong Kong residents typically avoid the specter of double taxation.

Furthermore, despite their worldwide taxation approach, many countries provide their residents operating businesses⟨9⟩ in Hong Kong with unilateral tax credit relief. Hong Kong even allows a deduction for foreign taxes paid on income that is also subject to Hong Kong taxation. This system dramatically alleviates concerns about double taxation for businesses operating within the region.
Nevertheless, the Hong Kong SAR government acknowledges the value of entering into comprehensive Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs) with its trading partners. These agreements clarify tax rights, help investors assess potential tax liabilities for their economic activities, and serve as an enticing incentive for overseas and Hong Kong-based companies to engage in international business.
As of 1 November 2024, Hong Kong has inked comprehensive DTAs with 51 countries and regions. Additionally, negotiations for such agreements are ongoing with 17 more, including jurisdictions like Germany, Norway, and Cyprus.

A unique challenge arises for airline operators due to the global nature of their operations, making them particularly vulnerable to double taxation. Recognizing the lengthy process of DTA negotiations, Hong Kong has adopted a policy of incorporating double taxation relief provisions for airline income into bilateral Air Services Agreements reached with aviation partners.
Shipping income is another area of concern. Hong Kong is actively negotiating double taxation relief for shipping income, particularly with jurisdictions that do not offer reciprocal tax exemptions or prefer bilateral agreements despite having such provisions. Some agreements even encompass both airline and shipping income.
Hong Kong’s onshore-offshore tax regime has garnered attention for its potential to reduce tax burdens by pricing intra-group transactions within Hong Kong companies. However, this has attracted increased scrutiny from the Hong Kong Inland Revenue Department (IRD) in recent years.
In response, the government introduced the Advance Pricing Arrangement (APA) ⟨71⟩program in 2012. This program, seen as a positive step for multinational companies, allows taxpayers to engage with tax authorities transparently and non-adversarially to achieve an optimal tax outcome. Notably, Hong Kong can only initiate an APA program with another country after signing a DTA with that country, further emphasizing the importance of these international agreements.
## List of DTA agreements
Hong Kong has signed comprehensive DTAs with 51 countries or regions. In addition, Hong Kong is negotiating comprehensive DTAs with 17 countries or regions, such as Germany, Norway, Cyprus, and Turkey.

## Double taxation elimination methods
The methods of eliminating double taxation are stipulated in the specific DTA or a country’s domestic law.
### Tax credit method
In most treaties signed by Hong Kong, residents can avoid double taxation through a tax credit.
Under the credit method, Hong Kong SAR shall grant credit for the tax paid in a foreign jurisdiction outside of Hong Kong regarding income derived by a person who is a resident of the Hong Kong SAR from sources of that foreign jurisdiction.
However, the credit should not exceed the amount of Hong Kong SAR’s tax computed for that income following the tax laws.
### Tax exemption method
In addition to tax credit relief, double taxation can be eliminated by tax exemption methods, reduced tax rates, as well as relief by deductions. However, these methods are not used as commonly as the tax credit method.
## Who can enjoy the benefits of DTAs?
Under most DTAs, only Hong Kong residents can claim tax benefits under the comprehensive DTAs. Taxpayers should refer to the protocol of the relevant DTA to check whether they qualify as Hong Kong residents.
In general, the following individuals can be regarded as Hong Kong Residents and thus can enjoy DTA benefits:
  * Any individual who stays in Hong Kong for more than 180 days during a year of assessment or for more than 300 days in two consecutive years of assessment, one of which is the relevant year of assessment;
  * Company / partnership / trust / body of persons incorporated or constituted in Hong Kong; and,
  * Company / partnership / trust / body of persons incorporated or constituted outside Hong Kong but managed or controlled in Hong Kong.


### Applying for Certificate of Resident Status
A Certificate of Resident Status is a document issued by the competent authority of the Hong Kong SAR to a resident who requires proof of resident status to claim tax benefits under the comprehensive DTA.
The Certificate of Resident Status should constitute sufficient proof of the resident status of a Hong Kong resident. The competent authority of Hong Kong will issue a Certificate of Resident Status after the DTA between Hong Kong and the relevant jurisdiction has become effective.
Did You Know
Generally, only one Certificate of Resident Status will be issued to an entity regarding each DTA for each year.
Applicants should be aware that a Certificate of Resident Status issue will not guarantee that they will succeed in their claim to benefits under the relevant DTA. It will be up to the treaty partner to determine whether all the applicable conditions are fulfilled and benefits can be granted.
To apply for the Certificate of Resident Status, the applicant needs to complete the appropriate form:
DTA Partner |  Form  
---|---  
Company / Partnership / Trust / Body of Persons |  Individual  
The Mainland of China (Mainland) |  IR1313A (06/2023) |  IR1314A (06/2023)  
Other Jurisdictions |  IR1313B (06/2023) |  IR1314B (06/2023)  
The completed form should be sent to the Tax Treaty Section of the IRD, and a Certificate of Resident Status shall be issued within 21 working days after receipt of a properly completed application. If further information is needed or the application cannot be accepted, a notification of decision by the assessing officer will be given within the timeframe.
## Advance Pricing Agreements
Hong Kong’s onshore-offshore tax regime often reduces the tax burden for those who operate through Hong Kong companies by pricing intra-group transactions. This has led to heightened transfer pricing scrutiny from the Hong Kong Inland Revenue Department in recent years.
Consequently, the Advance Pricing Arrangement (APA) program was introduced to Hong Kong. It was widely regarded as a welcome development for multinational companies, as it offers a non-adversarial approach in which taxpayers can transparently engage with tax authorities to achieve an optimal tax outcome.
An APA is an agreement that determines an appropriate set of criteria (e.g., transfer pricing method, external data, reasonable adjustments, critical assumptions as to future events) to determine the pricing of related party transactions over a fixed period. This is either three or five years.
Hong Kong can only start an APA program with another country after signing a DTA with the concerned country.

# Economic Indicators and Hong Kong's GDP, FDI, and Trade Trends
##  Hong Kong Gross Domestic Product growth and 2024 forecast
According to the
  

Contributing Advisor
Additionally, when adjusted for fluctuations, Hong Kong’s GDP increased 5.3 percent during the first quarter, showcasing the region's resilience in the face of recent challenges. These encouraging trends instilled optimism, with projections estimating growth between 4.0 percent and 5.0 percent for 2023.
The second quarter of 2023 witnessed Hong Kong’s revival progress, although slightly slower than the preceding quarter. Inbound tourism and increased private consumption were the factors contributing to this recovery. On a year-on-year basis, real GDP grew by 1.5 percent, reinforcing the durability of these sectors. However, there was a decline of 1.3 percent in real GDP quarterly when adjusted for variations, highlighting some ongoing challenges faced by the economy. Nonetheless, with relatively stable inflation, the government maintains its expectation that consumer prices will rise by around 2.0 percent in 2023.
The labor market has shown signs of improvement during the half of 2023, aligning with the economic recovery⟨69⟩. From May to July 2023, the unemployment rate after adjustments declined to 2.8 percent compared to the rate of 2.9 percent recorded in the quarter. Additionally, there was a decrease in underemployment from 1.2 percent to 1.1 percent. These figures indicate an improvement in employment opportunities as the economy bounces back.
The export sector, however, had experienced declining rates of 9.1 percent in July 2023 and 14.6 percent for the first seven months year-on-year. Despite the decline, services exports, particularly the travel and transport sector, continue to grow significantly following Hong Kong’s dynamic economic landscape. Although overall investment expenditure declined slightly due to financial challenges, private consumption expenditure experienced notable growth in the second quarter.
According to 3.3 percent⟨70⟩ by the end of 2023. Following an upward trajectory, the Hong Kong GDP Annual Growth Rate is projected to trend around 1.90 percent in 2024 and 2.10 percent in 2025
## Foreign Direct Investment trends
Hong Kong⟨5⟩ showcased undeniable economic prowess, achieving impressive milestones in various financial sectors in 2022. It emerged as a key player in both the outflow and inflow of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)⟨71⟩, ranking 7th globally for FDI outflows at a remarkable US$103.6 billion. Hong Kong solidified its position as the world's 5th largest FDI host, boasting an impressive FDI stock of US$2,09 billion. The city also secured the 5th spot for FDI investments with a total of US$ 2,05 billion. The UNCTAD World Investment Report 2023 acknowledged these exceptional figures, which recognized Hong Kong as a global magnet for FDI, placing it 4th worldwide with FDI inflows totaling US$ 117.7 billion in 2022.
Hong Kong's financial prowess extends beyond foreign direct investment (FDI) as it has established itself as a prominent economic hub in the Asia-Pacific region. According to a triennial survey by the Bank for International Settlements, Hong Kong emerged as Asia's second-largest foreign exchange market and the fourth-largest in 2022. Daily turnover of forex transactions witnessed a significant surge of 9.8 percent, with April 2022 recording transactions worth US$694.4 billion compared to US$632.1 billion in April 2019. Hong Kong's stock market retains its remarkable standing as the fourth-largest in Asia and seventh-largest worldwide, boasting an impressive total market capitalization of US$ 4.7 trillion as of March 2023. The city also showcases its fundraising capabilities by securing the fourth position worldwide in initial public offering (IPO) fundraising, raising a notable sum of US$12.7 billion through IPOs in 2021.
The Hang Seng Index (HSI) felt the pressure in the second quarter due to the Mainland economy's recovery momentum and expectations of higher rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve (Fed). The HSI concluded the quarter at 18,916, marking a 7.3 percent decrease from its end-March levels. In the real estate sector, the residential property market exhibited signs of consolidation after an initial rebound in the first quarter, as market sentiment turned cautious.
Forecasts indicate that Foreign Direct Investment in Hong Kong is set to reach HK$17 billion (US$2.1 billion) by the end of 2023, with further growth anticipated projecting an increase to HK$17.6 billion (US$2.3 billion) in 2024 and HK$18.4 billion (US$2.35 billion) in 2025. These projections highlight Hong Kong’s continued significance as a global financial and investment destination.
## Hong Kong trade trends
Consumer prices increased by 1.8 percent in July 2023 compared to the same period the previous year, but lower than the 1.9 percent increase in June 2023. The government expects inflation to stay relatively constant, forecasting an underlying consumer price inflation rate of 2.0 percent for 2023. This projection indicates a degree of confidence in the nation's economic stability.
The retail sector grew rapidly, with nominal retail sales surging by 19.6 percent year-on-year in June 2023. These positive trends continued throughout the first half of 2023, with a provisional estimate indicating a year-on-year increase of 20.7 percent. This retail activity surge underscores consumer spending resilience, a crucial driver of economic development.
Between May and July 2023, the labor market continued to improve steadily. The unemployment rate dropped by 0.1 percentage points to 2.8 percent during this period, compared to the 2.9 percent recorded in April-June 2023. These trends collectively paint a picture of an economy on the path to stability and growth.
Merchandise exports fell 9.1 percent year-on-year in July 2023, with a drop of 14.6 percent year-on-year for the first seven months of the year. Total exports of goods also registered a significant dip, plummeting by 15.2 percent in real terms in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same time a year earlier.
This decline continued the challenging environment, defined by slower external demand for goods, especially in major markets like the Mainland, the US, and the EU. Total goods exports slipped by 0.6 percent in the second quarter on a seasonally adjusted quarterly basis, following a modest 0.7 percent increase in the previous quarter.
Services exports increased by 22.9 percent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2023, following a 16.6 percent growth in the preceding quarter. The recovery of travel services⟨72⟩, driven by a surge in visitor arrivals, primarily contributed to this remarkable performance, which experienced an eight-fold increase and recovered to 48 percent of pre-pandemic levels.
Transport services also followed this upward trajectory. Financial services exports faced headwinds as cross-border financial activities slowed in the face of tighter economic conditions. Service exports grew 5.4 percent in the second quarter, following a significant increase of 16.8 percent from the previous quarter. The diverse performance of goods and services highlights the complex dynamics at play in the global economy.

# Profits Tax in Hong Kong
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/taxation-and-accounting/country-wise-tax-structure/corporate-income-tax)
Any entity, including corporations, partnerships, trustees, and organizations involved in any trade, profession, or business in Hong Kong, is subject to tax on all profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong (excluding profits arising from the sale of capital assets).
  

Contributing Advisor
Profits tax is levied based on assessable profits, which is determined by excluding deductions and tax-exempt incomes. It is further reduced by tax reductions, subject to a maximum.
## Profits tax rate
Profits earned by a corporation are taxed at a standard rate of 16.5 percent, while profits earned by unincorporated businesses are taxed at a standard rate of 15 percent.
The SAR has also implemented a two-tier tax profits tax system. The rates are as follows:
Two-Tiered Profits Tax Rates  
---  
Assessable profits |  Corporations |  Unincorporated businesses  
First, HK$2 million |  8.25% |  7.5%  
Over HK$2 million |  16.5% |  15%  
However, only one may elect the two-tiered profits tax rates for two or more connected entities⟨12⟩. All other entities are still taxed at 16.5 percent for corporations and 15 percent for incorporated businesses.
Did You Know
To avoid double benefits, enterprises that already benefit from preferential tax regimes, such as the corporate treasury center regime, aircraft leasing regime, etc., shall be excluded from the two-tiered profits tax regime.
Additionally, the assessable profits for sums received by or accrued to holders of qualifying debt instruments as interest, gains, or profits shall be excluded, as these should already be taxed at half the rate (8.25 percent or 7.5 percent, as the case may be).
## Concessionary rate
A tax rate of 50 percent of the normal profits tax rate will be applied to:
  * Trading profits and interest income received or derived from “short/medium term debt   
instruments” (issued before April 1, 2018);
  * Qualifying profits of a qualifying corporate treasury center (for the year of assessment   
2016/17 onwards);
  * Qualifying profits of a qualifying aircraft lessor or a qualifying aircraft leasing manager (for   
the year of assessment 2017/18 onwards);
  * Qualifying profits of a professional reinsurer or authorized captive insurer (for the year of assessment 2018/19 onwards);
  * Qualifying profits of a specified insurer or licensed insurance broker company (for the year of assessment 2020/21 onwards); and
  * Qualifying profits of a qualifying ship lessor or a qualifying ship leasing manager (for the year of assessment 2020/21 onwards).


A profits tax rate at 0 percent or 50 percent of the normal profits tax rate will be applied to:
  * Qualifying profits of a qualifying ship lessor or a qualifying ship leasing manager (for the year of assessment 2020/21 onwards); and
  * Qualifying profits of a qualifying ship agent, a qualifying ship manager, or a qualifying ship broker (for the year of assessment 2021/22 onwards).


Moreover, the concessionary profits tax rate for the assessable profits of (a) eligible family-owned investment holding vehicles managed by eligible single-family offices⟨70⟩ in Hong Kong and (b) family-owned special purpose entities earned from the qualifying transactions and incidental transactions for a year of assessment commencing on or after April 1 2022 is 0 percent.
## Exemptions
The following sums can be exempted from the assessable profits of a company:
  * Dividends received from a corporation which is subject to Hong Kong profits tax;
  * Amounts already included in the assessable profits of other persons chargeable to profits tax;
  * Interest on Tax Reserve Certificates;
  * Interest on, and any profit made in respect of, a bond issued under the Loans Ordinance (Cap. 61) or the Loans (Government Bonds) Ordinance (Cap. 64), or in respect of an Exchange Fund debt instrument or in respect of a Hong Kong dollar-denominated multilateral agency debt instrument;
  * Interest income and trading profits derived from long-term debt instruments;
  * Interest, profits, or gains from qualifying debt instruments (issued on or after April 1, 2018) exempted from payment of profits tax; and
  * Sums received or accrued in respect of a specified investment scheme by or to the person as: 
    * A person chargeable to profits tax in respect of a mutual fund, unit trust, or similar investment scheme that is authorized as a collective investment scheme under section 104 of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571); or
    * A person chargeable to profits tax in respect of a mutual fund, unit trust, or similar investment scheme where the Commissioner is satisfied that the mutual fund, unit trust, or investment scheme is a bona fide widely held investment⟨71⟩ scheme, which complies with the requirements of a supervisory authority within an acceptable regulatory regime.
  * A person is exempt from payment of profits tax in respect of the following sums: 
    * Interest (accrued on or after June 22, 1998) that is derived from any deposit placed in Hong Kong with an authorized institution, excluding interest received by or accrued to a financial institution; and
    * Starting from the year of assessment 2009/10, interest on and any profit made in respect of Renminbi sovereign bonds.


### Tax exemption on offshore profits
Hong Kong does not tax profits or revenue earned offshore⟨16⟩ under the so-called “territorial source principle of taxation.” It means that the profits tax is only levied if profits are derived in Hong Kong, the company carries out business in Hong Kong, and this Hong Kong-based business generates profit.

However, Hong Kong has implemented the 
Concerning the FSIE regime, Hong Kong’s Inland Revenue Department (IRD) amended provisions of the Inland Revenue Ordinance (IRO) so that it will now levy profits tax on certain types of foreign-sourced income that have been raised by a member of a multinational enterprise (MNE) group which carries out business or trade in Hong Kong when it receives this income in Hong Kong.
This foreign-sourced income includes passive income such as:
  * Interest,
  * Dividends,
  * Disposal gain from the sale of equity interests in an entity and other properties, and
  * Income from intellectual property.


Certain companies, such as regulated financial entities, are exempted from the FSIE regime about income derived from interest, dividends, or disposal gain. Specified foreign-sourced income received in Hong Kong will **not** be brought into charge if the MNE entity meets the exception requirements specifically for the particular types of income. The exception requirements are as follows:
Exception Requirements for Specified Foreign-Sourced Income under the New FSIE Regime  
---  
Exceptions |  Specified foreign-sourced income  
Interest |  Dividend |  Disposal gain |  General IP income (e.g. royalty)  
Non-IP assets |  IP assets  
Equity interest |  Others  
Economic substance requirement |  ✓ |  ✓ |  ✓ |  ✓  
Nexus requirement |  ✓ |  ✓  
Participation requirement |  ✓ |  ✓  
Meanwhile, as per the 2023 Amendment Ordinance, an intra-group transfer relief has been introduced to defer charging of tax on foreign-sourced disposal gain derived from the transfer of property between associated entities, subject to specified anti-abuse rules.

### Tax deductions
Hong Kong allows for a wide range of **profits tax deductible expenses** , enabling businesses to lower their overall tax burden. According to the Hong Kong Inland Revenue Department, "All costs and expenditures that the taxpayer has incurred in generating taxable profits are eligible for deductions."
Certain **expenses are non-deductible** when calculating assessable profits, including:
  * Domestic or private expenses not related to generating profits.
  * Capital losses or costs of improvements and any capital-related expenditure.
  * Amounts recoverable through insurance or indemnity contracts.
  * Rent or expenses for premises not used for profit-generating activities.
  * Taxes payable under the Inland Revenue Ordinance (IRO), except for salaries tax paid for employees.
  * Remuneration or interest on capital/loans payable to the proprietor, spouse, or partners, subject to section 16AA of the IRO.


Certain expenses, primarily those related to upgrading infrastructure for environmental protection, are eligible for deductions over a longer time. These are listed in the table below.
Deductible Expenses  
---  
Expenditure |  Details  
Building refurbishment |  Deductible over a period of five years in equal installments commencing in the year in which the expenditure was made.  
Plant and machinery specially related to manufacturing, and on computer hardware and software |  A full deduction is allowed in the basis period in which the expenditure was incurred.  
Environmental protection facilities |  A full deduction is allowed during the basis period in which the expenditure is incurred.  
Environmental protection installation |  A deduction of 20% of the expenditure is allowed in each of the five consecutive years commencing from the year in which the expenditure is incurred. A full deduction is allowed during the basis period (instead of over five years) in which the expenditure is incurred for procuring environmental protection installations [including any part of expenditure on environmental protection installation that remains to be deducted (and is to be fully deducted) in the year of assessment].  
Environmentally friendly vehicles |  A full deduction is allowed during the basis period in which the expenditure is incurred.

### Depreciation allowances
Hong Kong provides depreciation allowances for businesses to reduce their tax burden. The permitted allowances are detailed in the table below.
Depreciation Allowances  
---  
Industrial buildings allowances on industrial buildings and structures |  Initial allowance: 20% on the cost of construction of the premises Annual allowance: 4% on the cost of construction of the premises Balancing allowance or charge will be due upon disposal of the premises  
Commercial buildings allowances on commercial buildings and structures |  Annual allowance: 4% on the cost of construction of the premises Balancing allowance or charge will be due upon disposal of the premises  
Plant and machinery |  Initial allowance: 60% of the cost Annual allowance: at rates of 10%, 20 %, or 30% as prescribed by the Board of Inland Revenue in the Inland Revenue Rules, on the reducing value of the asset. Items qualifying for the same rate of annual allowance are grouped under one "pool." A balancing allowance is available only on cessation of a business with no successor. A balancing charge can, however, arise whenever the disposal proceeds of one or more assets exceed the reducing value of the whole "pool" of assets to which the disposed items belong.

### Donations
Charitable donations can be deducted from the assessable profits if:
  * They are made to 
  * In aggregate, total at least HK$100 (US$12) but do not exceed 35 percent of the adjusted assessable profits before deduction of donations (10 percent for years of assessment up to and including 2002/03; and 25 percent for years of assessment 2003/04 to 2007/08).


"Approved charitable donation" means a donation of money to:
  * Any charitable institution or trust of a public character that is exempt from tax under section 88 of the Inland Revenue Ordinance or
  * To the government for charitable purposes.


## Tax treatment of losses
Losses incurred during an accounting year can be carried forward and applied against future profits within the same trade. If a corporation is engaged in multiple trades, it can offset losses from one trade against the profits of another.
There are specific rules for gains or losses that fall under the concessionary tax rate to adjust losses between concessionary and standard trading activities.
Individuals who experience a trading loss and opt for personal assessment can deduct it from their total income.
## How to file profits tax return
If an entity carries on a trade, profession, or business in the form of a corporation, partnership business, or if a non-resident person is chargeable to profits tax in your name, you should complete the profits tax return, any required supplementary forms and other forms (IR1478 & IR1479) and file to the IRD by the due date.
### What are profits tax returns?
Profits tax returns are issued to corporations and partnership businesses for profits tax purposes. Profits from the carrying on of sole proprietorship business should be reported in tax return - Individuals (BIR60).
There are three series of profits tax return forms. You may download a specimen of the tax return forms for reference, but you should not use a printed copy of the specimen form for filing purposes.
### What are supplementary forms to profits tax returns and other forms (IR1478 & IR1479)?
Supplementary forms (IR1478 and IR1479) have been introduced for the 2022/23 assessment year. These forms report preferential regimes, tax incentives⟨26⟩, specified foreign-sourced income, and family-owned investment holding vehicles. All these forms must be submitted electronically.
If you submit your tax return and supporting documents in paper form, you should download and electronically fill out the necessary forms. Additionally, you must print and sign the Control List for these forms and include it with your profits tax return. The Control List should be signed by the person who signs the tax return.
However, you can use the Completion Service and Submission Service if you submit your tax return electronically or through semi-electronic filing. These services will link the uploaded data files to your profits tax return using the same profits tax file number and RIN.
### Who should file the profits tax?
  * Newly Registered Business: Generally, a newly registered business will receive its first profits tax return 18 months after the commencement of business or the date of incorporation.
  * Continuing Business—Annual Bulk Issue of Returns: The annual exercise to issue profits tax returns in bulk takes place on the first working day of April each year.


### Which businesses are not required to submit returns annually?
It is the practice of IRD not to call for the annual submission of profits tax returns when the trade, profession, or business carried on does not give rise to assessable profits or where the trade, profession, or business has not commenced or has ceased and not recommenced. However, upon receipt of a profits tax return, which may be issued while reviewing your future tax potential, the requirement to lodge the return form must still be complied with.
### When is the tax filing deadline?
**Standard Filing Time** : Generally, profits tax returns, any required supplementary forms, and other forms (IR1478 & IR1479) should be filed by companies within one month from the issue date. The compliance date of submission is specified on page 1 of the profits tax return.
**Further Extension for using Electronic Filing** : To promote electronic filing, the IRD will grant, on application, a further extension of one month after the expected due date, subject to the condition that corporations and partnership businesses will file the profits tax returns through the Internet. There are certain conditions that a corporation and a partnership must satisfy to use the Internet filing service.
### Block Extension Scheme for Lodgment of 2024/25 tax returns
If the tax representative has duly applied for an extension to file your 2024/25 profits tax return under the Block Extension Scheme, the due date is normally extended as follows:
Accounting Date |  Accounting Date |  Extended Due Date  
---|---|---  
For N Code Returns  
(Accounting Date between April 1 to November 30) |  May 2, 2024 |  June 2, 2024  
For D Code Returns  
(Accounting Date between December 1 to 31) |  August 15, 2024 |  September 15, 2024  
For M Code Returns  
(Accounting Date between January 1 to March 31) |  November 15, 2024 |  December 15, 2024  
For M Code Returns  
and Current Year Loss Cases |  January 31, 2025 |  January 31, 2025  
At the start of each year, the IRD (Inland Revenue Department) releases a circular Letter specifically for tax representatives on their website. This letter provides information about the lodgment procedures for the year's block extension scheme and explains how to apply for the block extension.
### Application for an extension for the submission of return
In most cases, extending the deadline beyond the already extended due dates within the Block Extension Scheme will only be approved under exceptional circumstances. If your company requires such an extension, please submit a written request and an explanation for the delay in lodgment, accompanied by supporting evidence.
Please refrain from assuming that any additional extensions will be automatically granted.
### What are the consequences of failing to file the tax return as required?
If a taxpayer neglects to submit an inaccurate tax return without a valid reason or doesn't meet the notice requirements, they may face penalties, potentially reaching up to **HK$50,000 (US$6,300)** , in addition to three times the amount undercharged. In the most severe instances, the responsible individual could even face a prison sentence of up to three years.
## Maximum tax reductions
Profits tax for the assessment year of 2023/24 is further reduced by the tax reduction of 100 percent, subject to a ceiling of HK$3,000 (US$384) per case. However, Legislative amendments are still required for implementing the tax measures in the 2023-24 Budget.
The reduction will be reflected in the final tax payable for the year of assessment 2023/24 but not in the provisional tax of the same year. Therefore, taxpayers are still required to pay their provisional tax on time despite the reduction measure.
## Provisional profits tax
Profits tax is imposed based on your assessable profits for each assessment year. Since these profits can only be determined after the conclusion of the respective year, taxpayers should calculate a provisional tax amount. Later, when the actual assessable profits for that year are established, taxpayers should conduct a detailed assessment. Any provisional profits tax already paid will be deducted from your tax liability under this assessment.
If you have valid reasons per the Inland Revenue Ordinance, you can request to defer some or all provisional tax.
### Application grounds
You can apply for an extension of provisional profits tax payment for the following reasons:
  * You may be eligible to apply for an extension of provisional profits tax payment if your assessable profits for the current tax year are anticipated to be less than 90 percent of the profits from the previous year or less than the estimated sum for which you are obligated to pay provisional profits tax.
  * When submitting your application, make sure to include supporting documents such as properly signed draft accounts covering a period of at least eight months.
  * You should consider applying if you have omitted or incorrectly reported the amounts of any loss carried forward for set-off in the current tax year.
  * Suppose you have ceased or plan to cease your trade, profession, or business before the end of the current tax year. In that case, your assessable profits for this year are expected to be lower than the assessable profits from the previous year or the estimated tax liability.
  * If you have chosen to be personally assessed for the current tax year, this election will likely reduce your tax liability.
  * Additionally, if you have filed an objection to your profits tax assessment for the previous tax year, which impacts the provisional tax charged for the current tax year, you may also be eligible to apply for an extension.


### Application time limit
Your application for holding over of provisional tax should be lodged no later than:
  * 28 days before the due date for payment of the provisional tax or
  * 14 days after the date of issue of the notice for payment of the provisional tax, whichever is later.


If the provisional tax is payable in two installments and the first installment has been settled by the due date, an application for holding over the whole or part of the second installment may be made subject to the prescribed time limit and grounds for application.
## BEPS 2.0
In the 2024-25 Budget Plan speech, the Financial Secretary said that Hong Kong will implement the global minimum effective tax rate in accordance with international consensus to safeguard Hong Kong’s taxing rights and maintain the competitiveness of the city’s tax regime.
In particular, the Financial Secretary mentioned that Hong Kong aims to apply the global minimum tax rate of 15 percent on large MNE groups with an annual consolidated group revenue of at least HK$6.3 billion (EUR 750 million) and impose the Hong Kong minimum top-up tax starting from 2025. It is now conducting a consultation on the implementation of the above proposals and expects to submit a legislative proposal to LegCo in the second half of 2024. It is estimated that these proposals will bring in tax revenue of about HK$15 billion (US$1.9 billion) for the Hong Kong government annually starting from 2027-28.

# Important International Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong Guide
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/tools/important-international-chamber-of-commerce-in-hong-kong-guide)
## What is the Chamber of Commerce?
A Chamber of Commerce, also known as a board of trade, is an organization formed by local business operators to advocate for the interests of the business community. These associations, which can be local or global in scope, aim to promote and protect their members’ interests through various initiatives, naming representatives, and discussing programs to endorse.
They play a pivotal role in local municipalities by advocating business activities, representing chamber members, and influencing policy related to the business and economic landscape. One notable example is the significant business hub⟨3⟩, the HKGC has, for 159 years, been an influential voice for businesses in Hong Kong⟨10⟩. Its primary functions encompass advocacy, connections, events, and offering business services, with a mission to support the business environment in Hong Kong and support its members in exploring new business opportunities⟨6⟩.

![Taxation & Accounting in Hong Kong⟨69⟩]
# Taxation & Accounting in Hong Kong
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/taxation-and-accounting)
According to the Basic Law of Hong Kong, the taxation system of mainland China does not apply to Hong Kong, which essentially means that the Special Administration Region (SAR) enjoys an independent taxation system. Since the city only imposes three direct taxes, Hong Kong has one of the most straightforward tax systems in the world. There are also generous allowances and deductions⟨26⟩ to reduce the burden on taxpayers.
  

Contributing Advisor
Hong Kong operates on a **territorial tax basis** , meaning that only income generated from within Hong Kong is subject to taxation. This unique structure provides substantial relief for businesses engaged in cross-border activities, as any income sourced outside of Hong Kong is exempt from tax, irrespective of the residency status of the taxpayer.
## Key features of Hong Kong’s taxation system
Hong Kong’s tax system has some distinctive features compared to other jurisdictions' taxation systems.
WATCH
#### Navigating Impacts of Hong Kong's Amended Foreign Source Income Exemption (FSIE) Regime

Taxes are only levied on a territorial basis, unlike most countries that apply both residential and territorial jurisdiction in determining tax liability. Only income arising in or derived from Hong Kong is taxable, whereas worldwide income is not taxable, irrespective of the residence status of the taxpayers. That said, some foreign-sourced passive income could be regarded as arising or derived from Hong Kong under the Foreign-Sourced Income Exemption (FSIE) regime, though tax exemption on profits tax can apply if certain conditions are met.
Further, there is no comprehensive system of income taxation in Hong Kong. Instead, a taxpayer is liable for tax on three different types of income. If an income fails to fall within any of the three specific tax provisions, then it shall not be subject to tax.
The three direct taxes are:
  * Profits tax⟨24⟩ : Companies in Hong Kong are taxed on profits derived from business activities conducted within the territory. For 2024, the profits tax rate stands at 16.5 percent for corporations, while unincorporated businesses, such as partnerships and sole proprietorships, are taxed at a lower rate of 15 percent. Importantly, offshore income, dividends, and capital gains remain exempt from taxation.
  * Property tax⟨25⟩: Hong Kong property owners are required to pay property tax at a standard rate of 15 percent on rental income generated from their properties. Property tax is levied on the net assessable value, which is the rental income after deductions for rates paid and 20 percent of rental income for repairs and maintenance.
  * Salaries tax⟨29⟩: Individuals working in Hong Kong are subject to a progressive salaries tax that ranges from 2 percent to 17percent in 2024, depending on income level. There are allowances and deductions available, such as personal allowances, mortgage interest deductions, and education expenses for dependents to further reduce tax liability.


Apart from direct taxes, certain indirect taxes, such as stamp duty and betting duty, are also collected.
Further, Hong Kong has no turnover taxes, making it a favorable location for profit shifting and re-invoicing activities.
Here are the taxes that Hong Kong does not impose:
  * No sales tax or value-added tax (VAT);
  * No withholding tax⟨30⟩ on dividends and interest;
  * No capital gains tax;
  * No tax on dividends; and,
  * No estate tax.


### Administration of tax and fiscal year in Hong Kong
The Inland Revenue Department charges Hong Kong’s tax administration. The tax assessment year usually runs from April 1 to March 31 each year. A company may also choose its fiscal year at its own discretion.
## Hong Kong tax rates for 2024: Summary of tax rates
Type |  Standard Rate |  Variations  
---|---|---  
Profits Tax |  16.5%, 15% |  Maybe tiered depending on income  
Salaries Tax |  2%-17% |  Tiered depending on income  
Withholding Tax |  0 - 16.5% |  0 - 16.5%  
Property Tax |  15% |  None  
Stamp Duty |  Transfer of stock |  0.26% |  None  
Transfer of residential property |  15% |  Certain transactions are exempt  
Transfer of non-residential property |  HK$ 100 - 4.25% |  HK$ 100 - 4.25%  
Lease of immovable property |  0.25% - 1% |  0.25% - 1%  
Buyers stamp duty |  15% |  None  
Customs and Excise Duty |  0% |  Exception: Certain goods must pay duties on import  
Hotel Accommodation Tax (HAT) |  0%  
Capital Gains Tax |  0%  
Dividend Tax |  0%  
Value Added Tax (VAT) |  0%  
Estate Duty |  0%  
## Profits tax
__Corporations are taxed at a standard rate of 16.5 percent, while unincorporated businesses are taxed at a standard rate of 15 percent.__
The SAR has implemented a two-tiered profits tax regime, which lowers the tax rate for the first HK$2 million (US$255,782) of assessable profits, which will be taxed at 8.25 percent. The remaining profits will continue to be taxed at the 16.5 percent tax rate.
For unincorporated businesses, the first HK$2 million (US$255,782) of profits earned will be taxed at 7.5 percent. The remaining profits will be taxed at the existing 15 percent tax rate.
Any party, including corporations, partnerships, trustees, and organizations involved in any trade, profession, or business in Hong Kong, is subject to tax on all profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong (excluding profits arising from the sale of capital assets).
Profits tax is levied based on assessable profits, which is determined by excluding deductions and tax-exempt incomes. The tax reduction, subject to a maximum, further reduces it.
### Principles of taxation
Since Hong Kong adopts a territorial source principle of taxation, only profits derived from a trade, profession, or business carried on in Hong Kong are taxable here. Profits sourced elsewhere are not subject to Hong Kong profits tax. The principle itself is very clear, but its application in particular cases can be contentious.
Over the years, the following principles have emerged from authoritative court decisions:
  * **Matter of fact** – the question of the locality of profits is a complex, practical matter of fact. No universal rule can apply to every scenario. Whether profits arise in or are derived from Hong Kong depends on the nature of the profits and the transactions that give rise to such profits.
  * **The operations test** identifies the operations that generated the profits in question and determines where they were carried out. The guiding principle is to examine what the taxpayer has done to earn the profits and where they were earned. The source of profits must be attributed to the operations of the taxpayer responsible for generating them rather than those of other entities within the taxpayer’s group.
  * **Antecedent or incidental activities** – the relevant operations do not comprise the whole of the taxpayer’s activities. The focus is on establishing the geographical location of the taxpayer’s profit-producing transactions as distinct from activities antecedent or incidental to those transactions.
  * **A place where decision is made** – the place where the day-to-day investment and business decisions take place is only one factor that must be considered in determining the source of profits. It is not usually the deciding factor.
  * **Gross profits from transactions** – the distinction between Hong Kong and offshore profits refers to the gross profits arising from individual transactions.
  * **Business presence overseas** – while a company may have operations outside of Hong Kong that generate profits, the lack of such a presence does not automatically mean that all profits arise in or derive from Hong Kong. However, if the company’s primary operations are in Hong Kong and there is no presence overseas, any profits earned will likely be subject to profits tax in Hong Kong.

## Property tax
__The property tax standard rate is 15 percent of net assessable value (NAV).__
The property tax⟨25⟩ is one of the most significant taxes people living in Hong Kong must pay.
Property tax is levied on income arising from the letting of immovable property, which is payable by the owner(s) at the standard rate of the year of assessment on “net assessable value” (NAV). Under the provisions of the Inland Revenue Ordinance, each and every joint owner or owner in common is responsible for reporting rental income on tax returns and paying property tax as if they are the sole owner.

## Withholding taxes
__Withholding tax rates range from 0-16.5 percent, depending on the payment category.__
Non-resident enterprises and individuals that derive income from a Hong Kong source for services rendered in Hong Kong are charged withholding tax.
Did You Know
Under Hong Kong’s territorial taxation system, resident and non-resident enterprises are treated alike and are liable for tax on profits arising in or derived from Hong Kong.
.
When a Hong Kong entity makes payments to a non-resident enterprise or individual for services rendered in Hong Kong, part of the amount must be withheld and paid to Hong Kong’s Inland Revenue Department. The percentage of the amount withheld is the withholding tax⟨30⟩.

## Salaries tax
__Income tax rates range from two percent to a maximum of 17 percent__ after deductions and allowances or 15 percent on net income after deductions. 
All individuals earning income from or derived from Hong Kong from an office, employment, or pension are subject to salaries tax⟨29⟩ in Hong Kong. Tax payable is calculated at a progressive rate on the “net chargeable income” or a standard rate on the “net income” (before deduction of the allowances), depending on which is lower. The tax reduction, subject to a maximum, further reduces it.
Tax Rates

Progressive rates (Year of Assessment 2018/19 onwards)

## Transfer Pricing
Transfer pricing⟨27⟩ is charged when transferring goods, services, and intangible property between a Hong Kong company and a related entity.
The Inland Revenue (Amendment) (No. 6) Ordinance 2018 (“the Amendment Ordinance”) establishes a comprehensive transfer pricing regime in Hong Kong. It codifies the transfer pricing principles, implements certain measures under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) package, and aligns the provisions in the Inland Revenue Ordinance (Cap. 112) with international tax requirements.
Hong Kong transfer pricing legislation is important to prevent tax avoidance in cross-border transactions.
### AEOI reporting
Under the Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information (AEOI) standard, financial institutions must identify financial accounts held by tax residents of reportable jurisdictions or passive non-financial entities whose controlling persons are tax residents of reportable jurisdictions in accordance with due diligence procedures.
Required information on these accounts has to be collected and furnished to the Department. Such information will be exchanged on an annual basis.
Hong Kong has expanded the list of reportable jurisdictions to cover 100 reportable jurisdictions for the more effective implementation of the arrangement relating to AEOI.

## Audit and compliance
Statutory reports are required annually for companies incorporated in Hong Kong. The reports must contain audited financial statements⟨32⟩ for the current year, with corresponding amounts for the preceding year, including a balance sheet, profit and loss account, and a cash flow statement.
Audited financial statements must be prepared and signed off by a certified public accountant on behalf of a business or non-profit organization to provide financial accountability and accuracy to stakeholders and people with a vested interest in the company.
 Also Read⟨32⟩ To understand audit and compliances in Hong Kong, read this section.⟨32⟩
## Accounting standards
As one of the two SARs of China, Hong Kong enjoys the right to develop its own accounting standards⟨31⟩ rather than applying the relative standards of mainland China. The Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA) is the only organization authorized by law to promulgate financial reporting and auditing standards for professional accountants in Hong Kong.
The accounting standards of Hong Kong are known as the Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRS), which have been fully converged with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). According to the HKICPA, HKFRS is designed to apply to general-purpose financial statements and other financial reporting of all profit-oriented entities.
Further, the HKFRS is designed to be applicable to the overall financial statements and other financial reporting of profit-oriented entities. It encompasses all reporting standards, accounting standards (HKAS), and interpretations issued by the HKICPA.

# Why Foreign Companies Relocate to Hong Kong
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/why-hong-kong/why-foreign-companies-relocate-to-hong-kong)
## Geographical proximity to China and the Greater Bay Area
As a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China, Hong Kong enjoys a highly active and cooperative business relationship with the mainland. It is both Hong Kong's leading conduit for foreign investment and its primary offshore capital-raising center. As one of the world’s largest IPO markets, Hong Kong is expected to attract more Chinese companies to list amid tensions between the US and China.
  

Contributing Advisor
Hong Kong’s geographic position enables businesses to easily tap into the various opportunities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA)⟨70⟩ and the mainland market. The GBA – now the world's largest and most populated bay area in the world – will strengthen Hong Kong’s geographical and economic ties with the mainland.

Further, the Mainland and Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) allows Hong Kong products and services easier access to the vast mainland market.
The CEPA goes beyond China’s WTO commitments, eliminating tariffs and allowing earlier or preferential access to some service sectors. Overseas companies can also benefit from CEPA. For trade-in goods, foreign investors can set up production lines in Hong Kong to produce goods that meet the CEPA rules of origin (ROO) requirements. For trade-in services, companies incorporated in Hong Kong by foreign investors can utilize CEPA as long as they satisfy the eligibility criteria of a “Hong Kong Service Supplier.”
Financial sector-wise, Hong Kong and Mainland China have made remarkable progress in opening new channels to enhance their financial connectivity, including the establishment of Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect and Bond Connect, Mainland-Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds arrangement, and the most recent two-way cross-boundary Wealth Management Connect in the GBA. Hong Kong’s status as an international financial hub is expected to be further strengthened under the GBA development plan.
## Simple and low tax regime
Hong Kong offers one of the most tax-friendly systems⟨23⟩ in the world. It imposes only three kinds of direct taxes – profits tax⟨24⟩ (for incorporated bodies), salaries tax⟨29⟩ (for personal income), and property tax⟨25⟩ (for income sources from Hong Kong property). There are also generous allowances and deductions to reduce the burden on taxpayers.
Did You Know
Hong Kong has no turnover taxes, including sales tax or value-added tax, making it a favorable location for profit shifting and conducting re-invoicing.
Unlike other jurisdictions, the city adopts a territorial basis of taxation – only income sources from Hong Kong are taxable. There is no distinction made between residents and non-residents. Therefore, a resident of Hong Kong can receive profits from abroad without incurring tax in Hong Kong, even if they are remitted to Hong Kong.

## One of the world’s freest economies
Hong Kong’s economic system is defined as a free-market economy characterized by minimum intervention from the government, low taxation, free port trade, and a highly internationalized and modernized financial market.
As one of the most Laissez-faire economies in the world, the government’s policy is strictly non-interventionist. The absence of exchange controls, corruption-free government, and free flow of information, capital, and talents⟨71⟩ has enabled Hong Kong to maintain a free and efficient business environment for business activities and commerce.
Further, Hong Kong is well-perceived for its “free port” and straightforward customs clearing. The city has no tariffs on imported goods and quotas, no dumping tax laws, and applies excise duties to only four commodities – hard alcohol, tobacco, oil, and methyl alcohol.

## Government support for businesses
Hong Kong offers robust government support for businesses, fostering a favorable entrepreneurship and economic growth environment.
The government actively promotes business-friendly policies, including simplified business registration procedures, easy access to government services through the online platform "GovHK," and streamlined visa arrangements for skilled professionals.
Keeping that in mind, foreign investors have several options to carry out business through multiple business vehicles⟨10⟩, including:
  * A company incorporated in Hong Kong;
  * A branch office of the foreign corporation;
  * A representative office;
  * Sole proprietorship; and
  * Partnership.


While some options are more commonly adopted than others, investors are advised to choose the most appropriate business structure based on the pros and cons of each option.
Further, the government agency 
## Developed financial services landscape
Hong Kong has established itself as one of the world's leading international financial centers. Businesses in this sector can leverage several factors:

## China–Ecuador investment
Find Business Support
Chinese companies have actively expanded their footprint in Ecuador, particularly in the oil and mining sectors. Several state-owned enterprises are involved in large-scale resource development projects. Notably, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and Sinopec jointly operate an oil block development project, while China Railway Construction Copper Crown Investment Co., Ltd. has fully invested in the Mirador copper mine. In both projects, Chinese entities hold a 100 percent stake, reflecting strong investor confidence and control over project operations.
### Ecuador’s investment appeal
Ecuador presents a range of strategic advantages that continue to attract Chinese investors:
  * **Favorable geography and rich resources** : Located on the northwestern edge of South America, Ecuador faces China across the Pacific Ocean and is one of the closest South American countries to China. It can serve as a gateway or transshipment hub for Chinese enterprises entering the broader Latin American market. The country’s diverse geography—comprising islands, coastal areas, mountains, and rainforests—supports a wide range of agricultural, aquaculture, and resource-based industries. Ecuador is particularly rich in petroleum and copper reserves.
  * **Abundant, youthful labor force** : Ecuador has a relatively young and ample workforce. With 13 million people of working age, approximately 70.9 percent of the total population, the country offers a solid labor base. Wages are comparatively low, making it a cost-effective destination for labor-intensive industries.
  * **Industrial underdevelopment and strong infrastructure demand** : Ecuador’s industrial base remains relatively underdeveloped, with limited availability of industrial goods, creating significant opportunities for market expansion. Infrastructure development has been a consistent priority for successive governments. While some improvements have been made, disparities remain across regions, and the need for investment in electricity, water resources, transportation, housing, and distribution networks remains high. Recent energy shortages have further highlighted the urgency of enhancing power infrastructure. Additionally, emerging sectors such as 5G, the Internet of Things, and big data offer significant potential for future investment.


**China–Ecuador agreements**
The institutional framework supporting China–Ecuador economic relations has evolved over the years, underpinned by a series of bilateral agreements covering investment protection, taxation, industrial cooperation, and trade.
In 1994, China and Ecuador signed the Agreement on the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments. However, in May 2017, Ecuador’s National Assembly voted to terminate 12 bilateral investment treaties, including the one with China, citing constitutional concerns over international arbitration provisions. While the previous Lasso administration expressed a willingness to renegotiate a new investment agreement with China, constitutional constraints hindered substantive progress. The current administration has focused on domestic security and financial issues, and there have been no significant developments on this front, with limited prospects for near-term progress.
Despite setbacks in investment protection, the two countries have advanced cooperation in other legal and commercial areas. In 2013, they signed the Agreement on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Tax Evasion, which came into force on March 6, 2014, and has been in effect since January 1, 2015.
Further deepening bilateral economic cooperation, several key memoranda were signed in 2016. These included:
  * A Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation in Industrial Parks and Special Economic Zones, signed between China’s Ministry of Commerce and Ecuador’s Ministry of Industry and Productivity;
  * A Framework Agreement on Production Capacity and Investment Cooperation, signed between China’s National Development and Reform Commission and Ecuador’s Strategic Coordination Ministry.


In December 2018, the two governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Belt and Road Initiative cooperation, aligning Ecuador with China’s global infrastructure and connectivity strategy.
A major milestone was reached in May 2023, when China and Ecuador signed a bilateral FTA⟨160⟩—China’s 20th FTA overall and Ecuador’s first with an Asian country. The agreement officially entered into force on May 1, 2024, opening new opportunities for trade and investment in both directions.
As of now, the two sides have yet to conclude agreements in emerging areas such as currency swaps, digital economy cooperation, or blue economy development.
## Why have Ecuador’s exports to China surged since 2020?
Ecuador’s rapid export growth to China since 2020 is the result of multiple reinforcing factors, with the signing and implementation of the China–Ecuador FTA playing a pivotal role. After years of negotiation, the two countries signed the FTA in May 2023—Ecuador’s first with an Asian partner. It officially entered into force on May 1, 2024. The agreement will gradually eliminate tariffs on over 90 percent of traded goods, including Ecuador’s core exports such as shrimp, bananas, and fresh flowers.
Although the agreement only recently took effect, the anticipation of policy benefits had already begun influencing trade. For example, Ecuador’s shrimp exports to China surged by over 30 percent year-on-year in 2023 as many producers expanded operations early to capture market opportunities.
At the same time, a strong alignment between China’s shifting demand structure and Ecuador’s supply strengths has accelerated trade momentum. Post-pandemic recovery in China’s food service industry drove demand for high-protein foods. Ecuador, as the world’s largest supplier of whiteleg shrimp, was well-positioned to meet this need. Meanwhile, China’s consumption upgrade trend has led to increased demand for high-quality fruits, organic agricultural products, and fresh flowers—all areas where Ecuador enjoys a natural advantage thanks to its favorable climate and advanced agricultural practices. Exports of Ecuadorian bananas and roses to China have steadily increased, deepening bilateral trade ties.
Logistics and infrastructure improvements have further supported this export boom. Chinese enterprises have contributed to the upgrading of Ecuadorian ports, while broader improvements to Latin America’s logistics networks have shortened shipping times and reduced supply chain risks. E-commerce has also played an increasingly important role. Platforms like Alibaba are helping Ecuadorian products reach Chinese consumers more directly, bypassing traditional intermediaries. This dual “online + offline” approach has become a standout feature of recent trade growth.
From a geopolitical and economic standpoint, deeper China–Latin America relations⟨161⟩ and evolving global trade dynamics have provided a favorable backdrop. Ecuador’s active engagement in the Belt and Road Initiative has facilitated cooperation on energy and infrastructure projects, indirectly boosting trade confidence. Simultaneously, U.S.–China trade frictions have prompted China to diversify its import sources, while Ecuador has sought to reduce its reliance on the U.S. and European markets—creating a complementary strategic impetus for stronger bilateral trade.
Policy coordination has also been instrumental. Frequent high-level exchanges have led to trade facilitation measures such as financing support from China Exim Bank, helping Ecuadorian exporters scale production and enhance competitiveness. Though sustainability concerns—such as the environmental impact of shrimp farming—remain, Ecuador has responded by upgrading technology and environmental standards in an effort to balance trade expansion with ecological stewardship.
Looking ahead, Ecuador’s exports to China are expected to maintain their upward trajectory, driven by the continued implementation of tariff reductions under the FTA and emerging cooperation in sectors like green energy and digital trade. However, rising competition from regional peers such as Peru and Chile, both vying for greater shares of the Chinese market, underscores the need for Ecuador to strengthen product differentiation, ensure quality, and build resilient supply chains to weather external uncertainties.

![Incentives for Doing Business in Hong Kong⟨69⟩]
# Incentives for Doing Business in Hong Kong
[](https://www.china-briefing.com/doing-business-guide/hong-kong/why-hong-kong/incentives-for-doing-business-in-hong-kong)
Hong Kong offers a range of incentives⟨6⟩ that cater to the economic objectives of the Special Administrative Region (SAR). These incentives are open to various business groups, including family offices⟨70⟩ and small enterprises, to foster robust economic growth and development within the region.
  

Contributing Advisor
## Why subsidies matter for SMEs
SMEs are the backbone of many economies, and in Hong Kong, they constitute a significant proportion of the business landscape. Government subsidies and incentives offer SMEs the much-needed financial support to address their operational costs, invest in technology, and expand their market presence.
Additionally, these programs serve as a risk-sharing mechanism, empowering smaller businesses to innovate and compete with larger players on a more level playing field. For entrepreneurs and startups, such initiatives can also open doors to collaboration, mentorship, and access to critical infrastructure.
## Incentives for family offices
Under the new scheme, a single-family office can be exempted from licensing under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) if it does not conduct business in Hong Kong; or perform any regulated activities.
The regulated activities include:
  * Dealing in securities;
  * Dealing in futures contracts;
  * Leveraged foreign exchange trading;
  * Advising on securities;
  * Advising on futures contracts;
  * Advising on corporate finance;
  * Providing automated trading services; 
  * Securities margin financing;
  * Asset management;
  * Providing credit rating services.


Did You Know
Family offices are also subject to mandatory licensing.
The specifics of it will need to be determined by reference to the facts of each case, including:
  * The person is performing an occupation or a duty that requires attention; the activity involves continuity;
  * The activity is capable of making a profit; and
  * The activity was carried out to make a profit.


However, two carve-outs could exempt a family office from licensing for asset management under the SFO, where the first applies to services provided exclusively to the office’s group company regarding the group’s assets, and the second pertains to activities connected to the trust service of a registered entity under the Trust Ordinance.
Below are the new measures designed to attract family offices to Hong Kong.
Incentives and Supportive Measures for Family Offices in Hong Kong  
---  
Capital Investment Entrant Scheme (CIES) |  Under this scheme, permissible assets will include equities listed in Hong Kong, debts issued by companies listed in Hong Kong, subordinated debts issued by authorized institutions, and eligible collective investment schemes. Approved applicants can reside and pursue development in Hong Kong with their spouse and dependent unmarried children.  
Tax concessions |  Profits tax exemption will be provided to family-owned investment holding vehicles (FIHVs) managed by single-family offices in Hong Kong. The government will also review the preferential tax regimes for funds and carried interest.  
Market facilitation measures |  These include the licensing requirements of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), particularly those catering to family offices. The regulatory body has established a dedicated communication channel maintained by its licensing team for family office-related inquiries.  
The Hong Kong Academy for Wealth Legacy |  The government will fund the setup of a new academy under the Financial Services Development Council, offering talent development services to industry practitioners and next-generation wealth owners.  
Art storage facilities at the airport |  The Hong Kong Airport Authority is actively exploring storage establishment, display, and appreciation facilities for art and treasures at Hong Kong International Airport as part and parcel of the Airport City development. It will enable global family offices with capital allocation in art to benefit from the thriving art ecosystem in Hong Kong.  
Hong Kong as a philanthropic center |  Enhance the processing of applications for recognition of the tax exemption status of charities. The Inland Revenue Department (IRD) will devise a standard form to facilitate the submission of applications and streamline processing. The IRD will also provide further guidance for applicants to facilitate precise statements of charitable objects. For tax exemptions offered to FIHVs managed by single-family offices in Hong Kong, enhance the legislative proposal by expanding the extent of beneficial interests that a charity may hold in an FIHV.  
A dedicated FamilyOfficeHK team in InvestHK |  The dedicated FamilyOfficeHK team will expand its role to cover services like facilitating philanthropic endeavors of wealth owners and assisting in education-related matters.  
A new Network of Family Office Service Providers  |  The FamilyOfficeHK team will convene and launch a new network of family office service providers, providing a two-way channel between the government and the industry to communicate on the latest policy developments.

## Funding schemes for marketing and business development
### BUD Fund and Tax Exemptions
The Hong Kong government's “
While the BUD Fund provides substantial financial support to eligible companies, understanding the tax implications of receiving such grants is crucial. In Hong Kong, the tax treatment of government grants like those from the BUD Fund can vary based on the nature and purpose of the funding. Generally, grants received for capital expenditures may not be taxable, whereas those intended to cover operational costs could be considered taxable income.
The BUD Fund introduced “
Eligible projects under Easy BUD fall into the following broad categories:
  * Design and production of promotional materials;
  * Advertising;
  * Participating in exhibitions and related expenditures;
  * Establishing and optimizing company web pages;
  * Mobile application for promotional purposes;
  * Testing and certification services; and,
  * Applying for product patent, trademark registration, or copyright protection.


### SME Export Marketing Fund
Like the BUD Fund, the SME Export Marketing Fund (EMF) is a Hong Kong government initiative designed to support Hong Kong-based SMEs in expanding into international markets. The EMF aids companies in conducting "export promotion activities," encompassing participation in:
  * Exhibitions both within Hong Kong and abroad;
  * Executing business missions;

Companies receiving grants from the BUD Fund should be aware of the potential tax obligations. It's essential to determine whether the grant should be treated as taxable income or if it qualifies for a tax exemption under Hong Kong tax laws. Consulting with a tax professional can provide clarity on whether the funds received need to be reported as income and how they should be accounted for in financial statements.
Understanding the tax status of BUD Fund grants can significantly impact a company's financial planning and net benefit from the funding. Proper tax planning ensures compliance with regulations and maximizes the advantages offered by the BUD Fund.

## Recent developments in Government Policy
The 2024-25 Budget introduces expanded incentives and tax policies to support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), focusing on easing operational costs and fostering growth. Key measures include enhanced tax deductions for reinstating leased premises and streamlined allowances for industrial and commercial buildings, effective from the 2024-25 assessment year.
In addition, funding schemes like the SME Financing Guarantee Scheme have been extended until March 2026, with an increased commitment of HK$10 billion (US$1.28 billion) to facilitate business financing. SMEs in the food and beverage and retail sectors can also access subsidies for digital solutions through the Digital Transformation Support Pilot Programme.
The Dedicated Fund on Branding, Upgrading, and Domestic Sales (BUD Fund) has been expanded to include all countries with free trade or investment agreements with Hong Kong. A HK$500 million (US$63.86 million) boost will help SMEs enhance competitiveness locally and internationally, particularly in e-commerce through the “E-commerce Easy” initiative. These initiatives reflect the government’s commitment to fostering SME resilience and growth.
## Tax incentives
Hong Kong's tax landscape is characterized by a generally low-tax environment⟨23⟩ with specific incentives tailored to different sectors. While the region does not provide extensive tax incentives⟨26⟩ for all companies, it benefits critical industries such as aviation services, financial services, and the shipping sector. Offshore⟨15⟩ funds that meet specific criteria can also be exempt from profits tax.

# Hong Kong Abolishes MPF Offsetting: What Employers Need to Know
April 2, 2025 Posted by China Briefing⟨159⟩ Written by  Reading Time: **10 minutes**
**_From May 1, 2025, Hong Kong employers will no longer be able to offset severance payments (SP) and long service payments (LSP) using Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) contributions, following the Abolition of the MPF Offsetting Arrangement. Businesses should be well prepared, including managing financial impact, allocating adequate resources, and navigating government subsidies effectively._**

Hong Kong’s MPF system was established in the year 2000, and from its inception, the MPF Offsetting Arrangement has allowed employers to use their mandatory MPF contributions to offset SP and LSP owed to employees upon termination.

## What is the Abolition of the MPF Offsetting Arrangement in Hong Kong?
On June 9, 2022, Hong Kong’s Legislative Council passed the Employment and Retirement Schemes Legislation (Offsetting Arrangement) (Amendment) Bill 2022, officially abolishing the use of employers’ mandatory MPF contributions to offset their SP and LSP owed to employees upon termination. The abolition will take effect on **May 1, 2025**.
### Key changes under the abolition
  * Effective May 1, 2025 (the “transition date”), employers can **no longer** use the accrued benefits from their mandatory MPF contributions to offset employees’ SP/LSP.
  * Employers can still use accrued benefits from voluntary MPF contributions and gratuities based on length of service to offset SP/LSP.
  * To prevent large-scale dismissals before the transition date, a “**grandfathering** ” arrangement applies to employees hired before the transition date.


### Grandfathering arrangement for pre-transition SP/LSP
Under the Abolition of the MPF Offsetting Arrangement, some employers may consider dismissing their existing employees immediately before the transition date and hiring new staff afterwards to make use of the employer’s mandatory MPF contributions to offset the employees’ SP/LSP. To reduce such risks, the Hong Kong Government put in place the below “grandfathering” arrangement for the pre-transition of SP/LSP of employees who were already in employment before the transition date:
  * Employers may continue to use accrued MPF contributions (mandatory or voluntary, made before or after the transition date) to offset the pre-transition portion of an employee’s SP/LSP.
  * The pre-transition SP/LSP is calculated based on the monthly wages immediately before the transition date and years of service before May 1, 2025.
  * Any SP/LSP accrued after the transition date cannot be offset using mandatory MPF contributions.


This major policy change strengthens retirement protection for employees while ensuring employers plan ahead for compliance and financial adjustments.
### Why employers should not dismiss employees before the transition date
Some employers may consider terminating existing employees before the implementation of the Abolition of MPF Offsetting Arrangement (i.e., the transition date: May 1, 2025) and hiring new staff afterward, believing this could reduce their SP or LSP liabilities. However, this approach does **not** result in cost savings due to the following reasons:
**No SP/LSP savings for early dismissals**
  * Employers can still use the accrued benefits of their MPF contributions to offset the pre-transition portion of SP/LSP for existing employees.
  * The pre-transition portion of an existing employee’s SP/LSP is fixed based on the employee’s wages immediately before the transition date and the years of service before the transition date. Therefore, any salary increases or continued employment after the transition date do not affect the pre-transition SP/LSP amount.


**Early dismissals may increase employer costs**
In fact, dismissing employees before the transition date may result in higher SP/LSP costs due to:
  * The employer’s MPF contributions, which can offset the pre-transition portion of SP/LSP, account for the employee’s entire service period. Retaining employees allows the accrued MPF benefits to grow, increasing the potential offset amount.
  * New employees hired after the transition date will accumulate SP/LSP from scratch, up to a maximum of HK$390,000, and none of it can be offset using the employer’s mandatory MPF contributions.


In conclusion, employers **should not rush to dismiss employees before May 1, 2025** , as it will **not** lead to SP/LSP savings. Instead, keeping existing employees helps maximize MPF offsets and avoid unnecessary financial burdens from new SP/LSP accruals.
##  **The c****alculation of SP/LSP after the Abolition of the MPF Offsetting Arrangement**
Understanding the calculation method for SP and LSP is essential for implementing the MPF Offsetting Abolition policy. Below are the calculation methods and the corresponding offsetting arrangements for employees based on their employment start date.
### **Employees whose employment commences on or after the transition date (May 1, 2025)**
**_Calculation of SP/ LSP:_**
**Employee****T****ype** |  **Calculation****F****ormula**  
---|---  
Monthly-paid employee | (last full month’s wages* before termination of employment × 2/3)** × years of service  
Daily-rated/piece-rated employee | (any 18 days’ wages* chosen by the employee out of his/her last 30 normal working days before termination of employment) # × years of service  
_* An employee may also elect to use his/her average wages in the 12 months immediately preceding the termination of employment for the calculation.__**The sum should not exceed 2/3 of HK$22,500 (i.e., HK$15,000)._ _The maximum amount of SP/LSP is HK$390,000._  
_**Offsetting arrangement:**_
**Accrued Benefits Derived From** | **SP/LSP Offsetable? (Y/N)**  
---|---  
Employer’s mandatory MPF contributions | No  
Employer’s voluntary MPF contributions | Yes  
Gratuities based on employees’ years of service | Yes  
### Employees whose employment commences before the transition date
_**Calculation of SP/ LSP:**_
For employees hired before the transition date, SP/LSP is divided into **pre-transition** and **post-transition** portions:
**Pre-transition portion of SP/LSP** | **Post-transition portion of SP/LSP**  
---|---  
Monthly-paid employee | (last full month’s wages* immediately preceding the transition date × 2/3)** × years of service before the transition date | (last full month’s wages* before termination of employment × 2/3)** × years of service starting from the transition date  
Daily-rated/piece-rated employee | (any 18 days’ wages* chosen by the employee out of his/her last 30 normal working days immediately preceding the transition date) # × years of service before the transition date | (any 18 days’ wages* chosen by the employee out of his/her last 30 normal working days before termination of employment) # × years of service starting from the transition date  
_*An employee may also elect to use his/her average wages in the 12 months immediately preceding the transition date/ termination of employment for the calculation.__**The sum should not exceed 2/3 of HK$22,500 (i.e., HK$15,000)._ _The maximum amount of SP/LSP is HK$390,000. If an employee’s total SP/LSP (i.e., the sum of pre- and post-transition portions of SP/LSP) exceeds HK$390,000, the amount in excess will be deducted from the post-transition portion._  
_**Offsetting arrangement:**_
**Accrued Benefits Derived From** | **Pre-transition portion of SP/LSP Offsettable?** | **Post-transition portion of SP/LSP Offsettable?**  
---|---|---  
Employer’s mandatory MPF contributions | Yes | No  
Employer’s voluntary MPF contributions | Yes | Yes  
Gratuities based on employees’ years of service | Yes | Yes  
### Case study
_**Scenario:**_
Company A, a Hong Kong-based entity, employed **Mr. Lee** on **May 1, 2020**. Company A plans to dismiss Mr. Lee, with his last day of employment set for **April 30, 2029**. Mr. Lee is entitled to **LSP** under the new MPF offsetting rules.
Mr. Lee’s monthly wage for April 2025 is HK$15,000, and the last full month’s wages before termination (April 2029) is HK$18,000. The accrued benefits derived from the employer’s mandatory MPF contributions are HK$88,200, and there are no employer’s voluntary MPF contributions or gratuities.
_**LSP calculation:**_
**LSP Component** | **Formula** | **Amount (HK$)**  
---|---|---  
****Pre-transition********portion**** (May 1, 2020 – April 30, 2025) | 15,000 × 2/3 × 5 years | ****50,000****  
****Post-transition portion**** (May 1, 2025 – April 30, 2029) | 18,000 × 2/3 × 4 years | ****48,000****  
****Total LSP entitlement**** | **98,000**  
_**Offsetting****a****rrangement:**_
**LSP Component** | **Amount (HK$)**  
---|---  
Pre-transition portion of LSP (offsetable using employer’s mandatory MPF contributions) | 50,000  
Employer’s mandatory MPF contributions withdrawn to offset LSP* | 50,000  
Post-transition portion of LSP (payable by Company A) | 48,000  
Employer’s remaining mandatory MPF contributions (retained in Mr. Lee’s MPF account) | 38,200 _(HK$88,200 – HK$50,000)_  
_* If _Company A has already paid LSP_ to Mr. Lee, the amount offset will be reimbursed to the company from the MPF account._  
## Subsidy scheme for Abolition of MPF Offsetting Arrangement
The Abolition of MPF Offsetting Arrangement policy will protect the retirement benefits of the employees in Hong Kong. However, it also increases the employers’ financial burden for the post-transition portion of SP/LSP.
To help employers gradually adapt to this new policy, the Hong Kong Government has introduced a 25-year subsidy scheme totaling over HK$33 billion (at 2021 prices). The scheme will partially cover employers’ SP/LSP expenses for the post-transition period.
### Key features of the subsidy scheme
Employers will **share** SP/LSP expenses with the Government based on a **specified ratio** each year, and two different subsidy structures apply:
  * For cases where the employer’s year-to-date accumulated expenses of SP/LSP fall within HK$500,000, there will be a “capped amount” per case in respect of the SP/LSP payable by an employer for the initial nine years. If the shared amount payable by an employer calculated according to the share ratio exceeds the “capped amount”, the employer only needs to pay the “capped amount”. The remaining amount of SP/LSP will be subsidized by the Government.
  * For cases where the employer’s year-to-date accumulated expenses of SP/LSP go beyond HK$500,000, the amount payable by an employer to such cases is calculated according to the share ratio with no “capped amount”. The remaining amount of SP/LSP will be subsidized by the Government.


**_Cases falling within the HK$500,000 threshold_**
For cases falling within the HK$500,000 threshold, please refer to **Table 1** below for the employer’s share ratio / “capped amount” in respect of the post-transition portion of SP/LSP per employee. The remaining post-transition portion of SP/LSP will be subsidized by the Government.
**Table 1: Cases Falling within the HK$500,000 Threshold**  
---  
**Years after the abolition** | **Employer’s share ratio / capped amount**  
1-3 | 50% or HK$3,000（whichever is the lower）  
4 | 55% or HK$25,000（whichever is the lower）  
5 | 60% or HK$25,000（whichever is the lower）  
6 | 65% or HK$25,000（whichever is the lower）  
7 | 70% or HK$50,000（whichever is the lower）  
8 | 75% or HK$50,000（whichever is the lower）  
9 | 80% or HK$50,000（whichever is the lower）  
10-11 | 80%  
12-13 | 85%  
14-19 | 90%  
20-25 | 95%  
**_Cases beyond the HK$500,000 threshold_**
For cases beyond the HK$500,000 threshold, please refer to **Table 2** below for the employer’s share ratio with respect to the post-transition portion of SP/LSP per employee. For the initial 12 years after the abolition, the remaining amount of post-transition portion of SP/LSP will be subsidized by the Government. From Year 13 onwards, no Government subsidy will be provided.
**Table 2 : Cases beyond the HK$500,000 Threshold**  
---  
**Years after the abolition** | **Employer’s share ratio**  
1-3 | 50%  
4 | 55%  
5 | 60%  
6 | 65%  
7 | 70%  
8 | 75%  
9 | 80%  
10 | 85%  
11 | 90%  
12 | 95%  
13-25 | 100% (no subsidy)  
**_Cases straddling the HK$500,000 threshold_**
For cases straddling the HK$500,000 threshold, where part of the SP/LSP paid by an employer to an employee exceed HK$500,000 (an example can be found in the case study below – Scenario III), the SP/LSP expenses within the HK$500,000 threshold will be calculated according to the higher subsidy ratio in Table 1, with “capped amount” calculated on a pro rata basis, whilst the remaining part exceeding the HK$500,000 threshold will be calculated according to the lower subsidy ratio in Table 2.
### Case study
Take Mr. Lee’s case for example; his last employment date falls into the 4th year after the abolition, and the post-transition portion of LSP is HK$48,000. Let’s assume his case will fall under the below three scenarios (based on the employer’s accumulated SP/LSP expenses in the year):
  1. **Scenario I** : In the 4th year after the abolition, Company A’s accumulated amount of post-transition portion of SP/LSP (for other employees) paid before Mr. Lee’s case is HK$100,000. Then, Mr. Lee’s case will fall within the HK$500,000 threshold.
  2. **Scenario II** : In the 4th year after the abolition, Company A’s accumulated amount of post-transition portion of SP/LSP (for other employees) paid before Mr. Lee’s case is HK$500,000. Then, Mr. Lee’s case will fall beyond the HK$500,000 threshold.
  3. **Scenario III:** In the 4th year after the abolition, Company A’s accumulated amount of post-transition portion of SP/LSP (for other employees) paid before Mr. Lee’s case is HK$470,000. Then, Mr. Lee’s case will straddle the HK$500,000 threshold. In this case, HK$30,000 will fall within the HK$500,000 threshold, and the remaining HK$18,000 will go beyond the threshold.


Please find the summary below for the calculation of Company A’s shared amounts of the post-transition portion of LSP and the Government’s subsidy amounts under the above three scenarios:
**Scenario** | **Post-transition portion** | **Shared Ratio** | **Shared Amount** | **Capped amount/Pro-rated Capped amount** | **Final Shared Amount** | **Government Subsidy** | **Reference Table**  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
(A) | (B) | (C)=(A) x (B) | (D) | (E)= MIN (C, D) | (F) = (A) – (E)  
**I** |  48,000.00 | 55% |  26,400.00 |  25,000.00 |  25,000.00 |  23,000.00 | Table 1  
**II** |  48,000.00 | 55% |  26,400.00 | N/A |  26,400.00 |  21,600.00 | Table 2  
**III** |  30,000.00 | 55% |  16,500.00 |  15,625.00 |  25,525.00 |  22,475.00 | Table 1  
18,000.00 | 55% |  9,900.00 |  N/A | Table 2  
### Impact on SMEs
Given that nearly 90 percent of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have annual SP/LSP liabilities below HK$500,000. These businesses will benefit the most from the higher subsidies and capped amounts in Table 1 for each SP/LSP case, reducing their financial burden during the transition period.
## Application of the Abolition of MPF Offsetting Arrangement
Find Business Support
The Abolition of the Offsetting Arrangement will also apply to certain occupational retirement schemes under specific conditions. However, it does not apply to employees who are not covered by the MPF System or other statutory retirement schemes, including domestic helpers and employees aged less than 18 or over 65.
Since employers are not required to make mandatory MPF contributions for such employees, they will not be affected by the abolition. Their SP/LSP, if applicable, will continue to be calculated based on their last monthly wages or 12-month average wages before the termination, in line with the existing provisions of the Employment Ordinance.
## Aggregate benefits received by employees after the abolition
For most employees, the total benefits (i.e., SP/LSP plus Employer’s Mandatory MPF contributions) to be received after the abolition will be higher than those under the current offsetting regime.
However, under special circumstances (e.g., a substantial pay rise after the transition date, long pre-transition employment period, short post-transition employment period), the total benefits after the abolition may be lower than those under the current offsetting regime.
To ensure employees do not lose out, the Hong Kong Government has committed to covering any shortfall should such cases arise.
## Dezan Shira’s insights: How to prepare for the Abolition of MPF Offsetting Arrangement?
Dezan Shira recommends that employers in Hong Kong take proactive steps to prepare for the Abolition of MPF Offsetting Arrangement policy in advance. Proper preparation will help employers adapt smoothly and remain compliant with the new policy:
  * **Financial planning:** The abolition of the MPF offsetting arrangement will increase employers’ financial burden, as they will no longer be able to use mandatory MPF contributions to offset the post-transition portion of SP/LSP. Employers should assess the financial impact and allocate sufficient funds to cover future SP/LSP expenses.
  * **HR document review:** Many employment contracts and employee handbooks may contain MPF offsetting clauses. Employers should review and revise these documents to ensure they align with the new policy.
  * **Employee communication:** Employers should educate employees about the abolition policy and its benefits. It is especially important to inform employees about the government’s shortfall compensation mechanism in cases where their total benefits after the abolition may be lower than under the previous offsetting system.
  * **Government subsidy application:** As part of the transition, the Hong Kong Government will provide a subsidy scheme to assist employers. However, this subsidy is reimbursement-based, meaning employers must first pay SP/LSP to employees in accordance with the Employment Ordinance before applying for reimbursement. Employers should familiarize themselves with the application process, prepare the necessary documentation, and ensure timely submissions to facilitate subsidy approval and disbursement.
  * **Keeping wage records:** To calculate the pre-transition portion of SP/LSP, employers must maintain wage records covering an employee’s 12-month employment period immediately before the transition date and six months after the employee leaves. This is in addition to the existing record-keeping requirements under the Employment Ordinance.
  * **Allocating sufficient resources:** The policy change will increase administrative workloads for HR and finance teams. Employers should allocate sufficient personnel and resources to manage the transition effectively.
  * **Seeking professional advice:** The Abolition of the MPF Offsetting Arrangement will take effect on May 1, 2025. Seeking professional advice can help businesses adapt efficiently and stay compliant.

# Trump Raises Tariffs on China to 54% – Overview and Trade Implications
April 3, 2025 Posted by China Briefing⟨159⟩ Written by  Reading Time: **16 minutes**
**_The US has increased tariffs on Chinese goods to 54 percent and introduced additional tariffs on other global trade partners. Set to take effect on April 9, these measures will heavily impact Chinese exporters and disrupt global trade networks. China is expected to respond with countermeasures in the coming days and weeks. Although dialogue between the US and China has been limited, the possibility of a future trade agreement remains open. We provide an overview of Trump’s China tariffs and discuss the implications for China’s foreign trade._**
* * *
On April 2, 2025, President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on global trade partners, citing a “national emergency” caused by unfair foreign trade practices. The new measures include a universal 10 percent “minimum base tariff” on all imported goods – fulfilling one of his key campaign promises – along with higher reciprocal tariffs targeting the US’s largest trading partners.
China faces one of the steepest tariffs, with Trump imposing an additional 34 percent duty. This is on top of the existing 20 percent tariff introduced in two rounds earlier this year, bringing the total tariff rate on Chinese goods to 54 percent.
The universal 10 percent tariff will take effect on April 5, while the additional 34 percent tariff on China, along with similar tariffs on other trade partners, will be implemented on April 9.
Trump has framed the 34 percent tariff as a “discounted rate,” claiming it is half of the 67 percent rate that his administration alleges China “charges” the US.
The 54 percent tariff is the latest in an escalating series of trade measures taken by the Trump administration against major trade partners, including tariffs on global steel, aluminum, and automobiles imports.
More tariffs are expected in the near future. A senior administration official told

## 54 percent tariffs on Chinese goods
The 54 percent tariff on Chinese imports follows a gradual escalation in duties levied on Chinese goods since Trump took office. In February and March, Trump raised the tariff rate on all Chinese goods to 20 percent, first implementing a 10 percent tariff, effective February 4, and then raising it by another 10 percent a month later.
Certain products will not be subject to the reciprocal tariffs, namely:
  1. Articles subject to 
  2. Steel and aluminum articles and autos/auto parts already subject to Section 232 tariffs (meaning the rate on these products will remain at 25 percent);
  3. Copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and lumber articles;
  4. All articles that may become subject to future Section 232 tariffs;
  5. Bullion; and
  6. Energy and certain other minerals that are not available in the US.


The reciprocal tariffs were first announced on February 13, 2025, when he signed a 
  * Tariffs on US products;
  * Unfair, discriminatory, or extraterritorial taxes on US businesses, workers, and consumers (including VAT);
  * Nontariff barriers or measures, including subsidies and regulatory requirements; and
  * Policies and practices that cause exchange rates to deviate from their market value.


According to WTO data, in 2023 (the latest available data), China’s simple average Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) applied tariff rate was 7.5 percent, with a trade-weighted average of 3 percent. In comparison, the US maintained a lower MFN applied rate of 3.3 percent and a trade-weighted average of 2.2 percent.
Breaking it down further, China’s MFN applied tariff rate in 2023 averaged 14 percent for agricultural products and 6.4 percent for non-agricultural products, while the US imposed lower rates of 5 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively.

China has also imposed various unilateral tariffs on US goods over the years, in addition to the ones levied in the last few months. On April 2, 2018, China implemented tariffs ranging from 15 to 25 percent on 128 US products worth US$3 billion, including fruit, wine, seamless steel pipes, pork and recycled aluminum in retaliation to the US’s steel and aluminum tariffs. Two days later, it again hit the US with 25 percent tariffs on US$50 billion worth of US goods, including automobiles, aircraft, beef, soybeans, whisky, and chemicals, in retaliation to the US’s imposition of tariffs on 1,333 types of Chinese products, also worth US$50 billion.
China has since granted exemptions for a variety of US goods, including agricultural products such as soybeans and pork, liquefied natural gas, crude oil, steel rails, certain medical equipment, and rare earth products, among others.

Besides higher tariff rates, the US has previously accused China of unfairly subsidizing the production of various goods to the detriment of the US’s domestic industries. China also imposes VAT on most goods and services, ranging from 6 to 13 percent, which the Trump administration could view as “unfair, discriminatory, or extraterritorial taxes on US businesses” and therefore are grounds for reciprocal action.
However, in his announcement on April 2, Trump claimed that China “charges” the US 67 percent, which serves as the rationale for imposing a “discounted” rate of 34 percent on China. The 67 percent figure 
This suggests that the reciprocal tariffs are based more on the trade deficit China has with the US, rather than the effective tariff rate and other non-tariff barriers as stated in the plan. The

China has already retaliated to the two prior tariff hikes with import duties in kind. In response to the initial 10 percent tariff hike, China’s Customs Tariff Commission announced a 15 percent tariff on American coal and liquefied natural gas and a 10 percent tariff on American crude oil, agricultural machinery, large-displacement cars, and pickup trucks. On the same day, China’s Ministry of Commerce and Customs Administration 
Following the second tariff hike, China’s Ministry of Finance 
It remains to be seen how China will respond to this latest and most drastic of tariff hikes, but it is likely that it will implement further retaliatory measures, potentially targeting key US industries such as technology, automotive, and agriculture, while also continuing to leverage its position in the global supply chain of critical materials and rare earth metals.
### Impact on China trade
The imposition of a 54 percent tariff on Chinese goods is likely to have a significant impact on Chinese exporters, particularly small manufacturers of consumer goods that rely heavily on the US market. Many of these businesses, which produce lower-cost items such as electronics, clothing, toys, and other consumer goods, are vulnerable to the additional costs that the new tariffs impose. These companies may struggle to absorb the additional costs without compromising their competitiveness or profit margins. As a result, many will likely need to explore alternative consumer markets to maintain sales, but this could prove challenging, given the highly competitive nature of global markets and the logistical challenges of shifting production and distribution networks.
Find Business Support
The US remains an important export market for China. In 2024, China exported US$524.66 billion in goods to the US, accounting for nearly 15 percent of its total exports, according to Customs data.
The tariff increase also threatens to spark inflationary pressures, both in the US and globally. Higher tariffs on Chinese goods will likely raise prices for US consumers, leading to a potential decrease in demand. As costs for American consumers rise, purchasing power will shrink, contributing to lower demand for goods not only from China but from other trading partners as well. In turn, this could slow global economic growth as consumer spending contracts.
Despite these challenges, Chinese exporters have the potential to shift their focus to other growing markets, such as Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America. These regions are seeing increasing demand for Chinese products, and while they may not yet match the scale or purchasing power of the US market, they present new avenues for growth. Chinese manufacturers may find opportunities to diversify their customer base, thus mitigating some of the negative impacts of US tariffs.
Moreover, the fallout from Trump’s tariffs on countries like Canada, Mexico, and those in the European Union could present an unexpected opportunity for China. As these countries face their own challenges in navigating Trump’s trade policies, they may look to strengthen trade relations with China. This could lead to a closer alignment between China and some of its smaller trade partners, as the restructuring of global trade may make it more advantageous for these nations to partner with China in certain areas, such as technology, manufacturing, and raw materials.
## End to de minimis exemption
On April 2, the same day the US raised the tariff on China to 54 percent, Trump signed an 
The de minimis exemption allows low-value packages – those worth under US$800 – to enter the US without customs duties or inspections. According to 
Trump had previously attempted to revoke the exemption as part of his February 1 tariff package but reversed the move within a week. On February 7, the White House issued an amendment delaying the change, following chaos at US logistics centers and customs warehouses. The US Postal Service had also temporarily suspended the acceptance of international parcels from the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong, but quickly reversed course.
The latest executive order claims that “adequate systems” are now in place to assess and collect duties on incoming parcels. As a result, the US will begin imposing duties on small-value packages from the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong starting May 2, 2025.
The Trump administration has justified the move by alleging that Chinese-based shippers use the de minimis channel to engage in deceptive shipping practices. The EO states that some Chinese exporters “hide illicit substances and conceal the true contents” of parcels, avoiding detection due to the limited screening associated with de minimis treatment. The White House has linked this to broader concerns about fentanyl trafficking, which it claims is facilitated in part through these small parcels.
Under the new rules, packages from mainland China and Hong Kong will be subject to the following duties:
  * Ad valorem duty of 30 percent of the declared value of the postal item
  * Specific duty: 
    * US$25 per item between May 2 and May 31, 2025
    * US$50 per item beginning June 1, 2025


The EO also directs the Secretary of Commerce to make an assessment of the potential impact of the order on American consumers and businesses, and provide a recommendation on whether the end of the exemption should also be extended to Macau “to prevent circumvention of this order”.
### Impact on China trade
The end of the de minimis exemption is expected to significantly disrupt the US e-commerce landscape, with ripple effects for consumers, global logistics networks, and the broader trade environment. Online platforms such as Shein⟨14⟩, Temu, and Amazon, along with thousands of small and mid-sized US businesses that rely on low-cost Chinese imports, are particularly vulnerable.
Speaking to the 
Wang also noted that the US policy shift could act as a precedent for other governments, potentially triggering a wave of tighter regulations elsewhere. The EU, Thailand, Vietnam, and Singapore are reportedly considering similar policy adjustments, suggesting broader global scrutiny of low-value imports and efforts to curb China’s export-driven digital commerce model.
However, in the US, large platforms like Shein and Temu may be able to absorb some of the impact by adapting their operations. Speaking to the 
Meanwhile, according to the _New York Times_ report, both Shein and Temu have already been diversifying by partnering with US vendors and establishing warehouses in the US, which could mitigate some disruptions. Aaron Rubin, CEO of ShipHero, a warehouse management software company, emphasized that the EO will not destroy companies like Shein or Temu, rather, it will “change the business model”.
The end of the de minimis exemption is nonetheless expected to have a significant impact on smaller American businesses who rely on these cheap imports from China, and will find it difficult to pass on the costs to their price-sensitive consumers. Additionally, it is also expected to affect millions of US consumers, who will experience delivery delays, higher prices, or both.
## 25 percent steel and aluminum tariffs
On February 10, Trump signed proclamations 
Trump first imposed tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum in 2018 following the release of the Section 232 Investigation, which found that steel and aluminum products were arriving in the US “in such quantities and under such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security” of the country.
In 2018, Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports after a Section 232 Investigation found that these imports threatened US national security. According to the steel proclamation, the 25 percent steel tariff initially reduced reliance on imports and boosted domestic consumption. However, due to exemptions and agreements made during both the Trump and Biden administrations, imported steel now makes up a similar portion of US consumption as before the tariffs.
Meanwhile, the aluminum declaration states that the 10 percent aluminum tariff was less effective, as efforts to bypass the tariff and various country exemptions led to a decline in domestic aluminum smelter capacity utilization, preventing the tariff from achieving its intended national security goals. Both proclamations highlight a global excess capacity crisis for steel and aluminum, with rising Chinese steel exports displacing production in other countries and leading to increased steel imports to the US.
The Biden administration had already raised the tariff on imports of Chinese steel and aluminum products to 25 percent in September 2024. This means that China’s steel and aluminum were already subject to a 25 percent tariff when entering the US before Trump imposed his new tariff regime. Moreover, the 10 percent tariff on aluminum coming from China has remained in place since 2018.
### Impact on China trade
China currently exports relatively small amounts of steel and aluminum directly to the US, accounting for just 0.8 percent of China’s total steel exports in 2024.
However, the global nature of Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs means that Chinese steel exports to other countries may be impacted. Major sources for US steel imports, such as Vietnam and Canada, accounted for 25.22 percent of China’s total steel exports in 2024, according to
Find Business Support
Similarly, China’s aluminum exports to the US have already been declining for four consecutive years, making up just 8.2 percent of China’s total aluminum exports in 2024, according to 
China’s annual aluminum exports are 
According to Li Kui, a non-ferrous metals researcher at Huarong Rongda Futures, while the short-term impact of Trump’s tariff hike may be limited, in the medium to long term, it could negatively affect China’s aluminum export trade. China has historically faced anti-dumping duties ranging from 10 percent to 75 percent across various countries, leading to a 30 percent to 60 percent decline in exports. Trump’s new tariffs will raise the duties on some Chinese aluminum products from 7.5 percent to 25 percent, which could further deter direct shipments to the US while closing off indirect export routes through Mexico and Canada.
## 25 percent tariff on global auto imports
On March 26, Trump signed a 
Revitalizing the once-thriving US automobile industry has been a key pillar of Trump’s economic agenda, closely tied to his promise to bring back manufacturing jobs. The proclamation highlights that in 1985, US factories produced 97 percent of the vehicles sold domestically. By contrast, in 2024, 50 percent of the 16 million vehicles purchased by Americans were imported, with only 25 percent of their content manufactured in the US.
### Impact on China Trade
Although China is a leading global car producer and exporter, the US is not a primary market for Chinese vehicles. As a result, China is not the main target of this tariff, which is instead aimed at major US trading partners such as Mexico, Japan, South Korea, and Germany.
According to ITC Trade Map, China exported US$20.4 billion worth of vehicles and auto parts to the US in 2024, accounting for just 5.2 percent of total US auto imports by value. China’s top vehicle export destinations in 2024 included Russia, Mexico, the United Arab Emirates, and Brazil. Meanwhile, Western Europe and Southeast Asia were the largest markets for Chinese electric vehicles (EVs), with the UK and Belgium leading in Europe and Thailand leading in Asia.
## US-China dialogue and possible trade negotiations
Trump’s escalation of tariffs on China and his generally confrontational stance toward global trade make a potential trade deal between the US and China in the near future seem unlikely. However, both sides have expressed the need to come to the negotiating table to resolve their ongoing trade tensions.
According to the White House 
Find Business Support
A video call held on March 26 between US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng suggested little progress on potential negotiations. Greer emphasized Trump’s commitment to a trade policy that strengthens domestic industry and ensures fair competition, while He conveyed China’s concerns over additional tariffs, particularly those related to fentanyl and the Section 301 investigation. Both sides agreed on the importance of maintaining stable economic relations, but no significant breakthroughs were made.
On March 23, Chinese Premier Li Qiang met with US Senator Steve Daines in Beijing during the annual China Development Forum. Li emphasized the importance of dialogue and cooperation, warning that escalating tensions would harm both countries’ economic and trade interests. This meeting, the first between Chinese and US officials since Trump took office, signals a desire for continued communication and collaboration, even amid growing trade disputes.
Trump also stated in early February that he had spoken to Xi Jinping, describing their relationship as very positive; however, the Chinese side has not confirmed these discussions.
It is unlikely that substantial progress will be made until there can be a face-to-face meeting between Trump and President Xi Jinping. Trump’s personal politics, including his respect for Xi and his susceptibility to flattery, suggest that a meeting could be pivotal in persuading him to reach an agreement.

The possibility of a trade deal between the US and China hinges on several factors. Previous trade agreements, such as the Phase One trade deal reached under Trump’s first term, have shown that both sides are capable of reaching agreements on specific issues, such as intellectual property protections, agricultural exports, and currency manipulation.
Trump has suggested he may consider lowering tariffs on China in exchange for a deal involving the Chinese-owned social media app TikTok, which is facing an April 5 deadline to be sold or face a potential US ban. This could provide a potential leverage point for negotiation and allow China to give Trump a “win”.
However, a more comprehensive deal would require significant concessions on both sides.
For a successful trade deal to materialize, China would likely need to address US concerns over nonreciprocal trade practices, such as the alleged forced technology transfers and unfair market access. On the other hand, the US would need to reduce its tariffs in exchange for concrete progress in these areas. Additionally, continued dialogue between the two nations, especially through direct meetings between Trump and Xi, could help break the deadlock and create an environment conducive to further negotiations. The tone of past trade deals suggests that personalized diplomacy and the willingness to reach mutually beneficial agreements will be key to advancing any future US-China trade resolution.

  * **Hong Kong further loosens quarantine requirements.** According to a  posted on the Hong Kong government website, from Friday, December 9 onwards, the quarantine period for people infected with COVID-19 has been reduced from seven days to just five days. People that have tested positive for COVID-19 can now be released from quarantine if they test negative on a rapid antigen test (RAT) on days 4 and 5 after being placed into quarantine. Close contacts of infected people can now also be discharged on day 5 if they test negative on a RAT every day for the duration of the quarantine period. In addition, people arriving from Taiwan or overseas will now only be required to take RATs after arrival in Hong Kong, rather than a nucleic acid test. Previously, overseas arrivals were required to take nucleic acid tests on the first two days after arrival. The new requirements are effective from December 9 onward and apply retroactively to people who arrived in Hong Kong prior to this date and are still in self-isolation as of December 9. 
  * **China’s travel code to go offline from December 13.** Chinese media have  that the travel code (通信行程卡), which was used to track whether people had traveled to areas with COVID-19 cases, will officially go offline from December 13 onward.

Some analyses said, “the changes may prove too much and too soon”. To cope with the situation, the National Health Commission (NHC) has released multiple circulars to guide the home quarantine and medical treatment process for the COVID confirmed cases. In addition to the 
  * **China abandons the health code and centralized quarantine, along with new relaxed measures.** As of December 7, 2022, the 


  1. **Risk areas confined to building and specific floors:** Moving forward, risk areas will only be identified by the specific apartment, building, unit, or floor. Authorities are not allowed to arbitrarily classify a whole residential community, neighborhood, district, etc. in a high-risk region.
  2. **Health Code and COVID-19 tests requirements:** PCR tests will still be required in high-risk areas. However, other venues, establishments, or public places—aside from nursing homes, medical facilities, kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, etc.—will no longer require testing or performing health code checks. Additionally, people traveling to China Additionally, if you travel to China, will no longer be asked to check their health code upon arrival if the COVID-19 test results are negative.
  3. **Infected people can now isolate at home:** Infected people, including those who are asymptomatic or have “minor” symptoms, can isolate at home or in a dedicated facility. After six-to-seven days of home isolation, if double COVID-19 test results are negative, the patient will be released from isolation. Close contacts will also be able to conduct home quarantine for five days or can choose to isolate in a dedicated facility.
  4. **Put “Quickly Lockdown, Quickly Release” into practice:** After five days in a row with no new reported cases, high-risk areas (now only specified to particular floors and rooms in buildings) can promptly have their restrictions lifted.
  5. **Make sure that everyone has access to health care:** All pharmacies should be open for business and should not be forced to close. Online and offline sales of over-the-counter medications shouldn’t be prohibited.
  6. **Vaccinate senior citizens:** To increase the immunization rate for those between the ages of 60 and 79 as well as those 80 and older, all communities should adhere to the maxim “do everything feasible.”
  7. **Improve population health status:** Family physicians and neighborhood clinics would be granted complete authority as the “gatekeepers of health.”
  8. **Make sure society runs normally and that basic medical services are available:** Personnel mobility must not be restricted, and labor, manufacturing, or business operations must not be stopped in low-risk locations.
  9. **Implement security:** To guarantee that individuals may leave to go to a doctor for medical treatment and emergency refuge, it is completely prohibited to block fire routes, unit doors, and community doors in a variety of ways.
  10. **Improve prevention and control measures in education:** Nationwide criteria for accurate prevention and control should be firmly implemented in schools. Schools that are not affected by the virus should continue their regular offline instruction, and on-campus stores, canteens, stadiums, and libraries should operate normally.

On January 20, 2025, Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States. His return to the White House signals a shift in US-China relations. Building on the aggressive stance of his first term, Trump 2.0 is expected to challenge China with a more transactional and unpredictable approach. The economic, security, and diplomatic consequences of his policies will not only reshape US-China ties but also influence the broader global geopolitical landscape.
Find Business Support
Trump is expected to intensify the trade confrontations that defined his first administration, potentially escalating tariffs and sanctioning Chinese companies in an effort to achieve greater economic self-sufficiency. However, his focus on America’s immediate interests may leave little room for long-term strategic alliances, making his policy more difficult to predict. As Trump looks to navigate his second term amid a tumultuous political backdrop, China will need to adapt quickly to a US president who is more focused on leveraging short-term victories than on pursuing traditional diplomatic strategies.
This timeline will track the key developments in US-China relations under Trump 2.0, examining the potential consequences for China’s economy and other key aspects, while offering insights into the strategies that both Washington and Beijing will adopt in the face of a renewed geopolitical rivalry.

## US-China relations in the Trump 2.0 era
### **April 2, 2025: Trump reinstates end to de minimis exemption on Chinese parcels, effective May 2**
On Wednesday, the same day the US tariff rate on Chinese imports was raised to 54 percent, President Donald Trump signed an 
The de minimis exemption allows low-value packages – those worth under US$800 – to enter the US without customs duties or inspections. According to 
Trump had previously attempted to revoke the exemption as part of his February 1 tariff package but reversed the move within a week. On February 7, the White House issued an amendment delaying the change, following chaos at US logistics centers and customs warehouses. The US Postal Service had also temporarily suspended the acceptance of international parcels from the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong, but quickly reversed course.
The latest executive order claims that “adequate systems” are now in place to assess and collect duties on incoming parcels. As a result, the US will begin imposing duties on small-value packages from the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong starting May 2, 2025.
The Trump administration has justified the move by alleging that Chinese-based shippers use the de minimis channel to engage in deceptive shipping practices. The EO states that some Chinese exporters “hide illicit substances and conceal the true contents” of parcels, avoiding detection due to the limited screening associated with de minimis treatment. The White House has linked this to broader concerns about fentanyl trafficking, which it claims is facilitated in part through these small parcels.
Under the new rules, packages from mainland China and Hong Kong will be subject to the following duties:
  * Ad valorem duty of 30 percent of the declared value of the postal item
  * Specific duty: 
    * US$25 per item between May 2 and May 31, 2025
    * US$50 per item beginning June 1, 2025


The EO directs the Secretary of Commerce to make an assessment of the potential impact of the order on American consumers and businesses, and provide a recommendation on whether the end of the exemption should also be extended to Macau “to prevent circumvention of this order”.
The end of the exemption is expected to have widespread implications for online retailers such as Shein, Temu, and Amazon, as well as for smaller US businesses that rely on low-cost Chinese imports. 
### **April 2, 2025 – Trump imposes sweeping tariffs, raising Chinese import duties to 54%**
​On April 2, 2025, President Donald Trump  This “Liberation Day” initiative aims to address perceived trade imbalances and bolster domestic industries.​
Key highlights inlcude:
  * Universal tariff: A baseline 10 percent tariff will be applied to all imports entering the United States. ​
  * China-specific tariffs: Chinese imports will face an additional 34 percent tariff on top of the existing 20 percent, culminating in a total tariff rate of 54 percent.
  * Tariffs on other nations: Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, the European Union, and Japan will be subject to new tariffs of 46 percent, 36 percent, 49 percent, 20 percent, and 24 percent, respectively.
  * Sector-specific tariffs: Additional duties of 25 percent will be imposed on foreign automobiles, car parts, steel, and aluminum. ​


The universal 10 percent import tariff is set to take effect on April 5, 2025.​ The additional “reciprocal” tariffs targeting specific countries will commence on April 9, 2025. ​The additional 25 percent tariff on foreign automobiles, car parts, steel, and aluminum would go into effect at midnight, April 3, 2025.
The announcement has led to significant volatility in global financial markets. Analysts express concerns about potential inflationary pressures and disruptions to international trade. While supporters argue that these measures will revitalize American manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign goods, critics warn of escalating trade tensions and possible retaliatory actions from affected nations. ​As the situation develops, stakeholders across various sectors are advised to monitor policy changes closely and assess their potential impact on international trade and economic stability.​
### **March 26, 2025 – US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer Holds Video Call with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng**
US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng held a video call on March 26 to discuss the US-China economic and trade relationship. According to the US Trade Representative (USTR) 
Meanwhile, according to the China State Council 
The meeting took place against the backdrop of Trump’s 20 percent tariffs on Chinese goods, which remain a key issue in bilateral trade talks. According to 
### **March 25, 2025 – US Commerce Department adds over 50 Chinese Entities to Entity List**
The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) under the US Department of Commerce added 80 entities from a range of countries, over 50 of which are from China. According to the 
The entities notably include six subsidiaries of the Chinese cloud computing and big data services provider Inspur Group, including Inspur’s subsidiary in Taiwan (Inspur Taiwan). These entities were added “for their contributions to Inspur’s development of supercomputers for military end use, particularly by acquiring or attempting to acquire U.S.-origin items in support of supercomputer projects for the Chinese government and/or military”.
Inspur Group was placed on the Entity List in 2023.
Other entities added to the list include the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, a non-profit AI research lab; Nettrix Information Industry, a server manufacturer and IT system provider; and Suma Technology.
Companies included on the Entity List will be subject to export restrictions, and US companies will be unable to do business with the entities without a license.
In a regular press briefing on Tuesday, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Guo Jiakun called the latest action “an abuse of [the US’s] entity list and other export controls” and that they were in violation of international law. He also repeated the line that “China will take necessary steps to firmly safeguard the lawful rights and interests of Chinese companies”, suggesting possible retaliation.
### **March 23, 2025: Premier Li Qiang meets with US Senator Steve Daines**
Chinese Premier Li Qiang met with Republican Senator Steve Daines, along with a group of American business executives in Beijing as a part of the annual China Development Forum.
According to the readout of the meeting, Li urged communication between China and the US, stating that “Both sides should choose dialogue rather than confrontation, and choose win-win cooperation instead of a zero-sum game.”
He also emphasized the importance of trade in bilateral relations, warning that “the more difficulties bilateral relations face, the more important it is to safeguard and develop China-US economic and trade cooperation.”
This was the first meeting between Chinese and US officials since Trump took office in January and comes amid an escalating trade war that has seen the US place 20 percent tariffs on goods coming from China.
During the last Trump administration, Daines 
When asked in a 
### **March 20, 2025: US Department of State and US Treasury Secretary sanction a Chinese oil terminal and refinery**
The US Department of State on Thursday 
In addition, the Treasury sanctioned 12 entities and one individual and identified eight vessels as blocked property (property owned by sanctioned entities) for purportedly being part of Iran’s so-called “shadow fleet” of tankers, which ship “millions of barrels of Iranian oil to China”.
These sanctions are designed to end Iran’s oil exports. The US alleges that income derived from Iran’s oil exports is funding Iran’s attacks on US allies and helping to fund US-designated terrorist groups.
In a regular 
### **March 4, 2025: China counters Trump’s tariffs with duties on US agricultural products**
China’s Ministry of Finance (MOF) has 
The tariffs on US goods are as follows:
  1. A 15 percent tariff on chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton.
  2. A 10 percent tariff on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products.


The MOF announcement stated that “the unilateral tariff increase by the US side undermines the multilateral trading system, increases the burden on US companies and consumers, and undermines the basis for economic and trade cooperation between China and the US.”
The tariffs will come into effect on March 10.
In a separate announcement, China’s Ministry of Commerce 
The targeting of US agricultural products is calculated. China is one of the world’s largest importers of agricultural products and a major buyer of US soybeans, corn, and sorghum. Agricultural products were a core component of the trade deal struck between China and the Trump administration in 2019, which saw China commit to purchasing around US$200 billion in agricultural goods from the US over a two-year period.
The US’s agricultural producers are also mainly located in the US’s red states, meaning the tariffs will hit Trump’s core voter base the hardest.
### **March 3, 2025: Trump raises tariffs on Chinese goods to 20%, effective March 4**
The Trump administration has officially raised the tariff rate on Chinese imports from 10 to 20 percent through an 
The new tariff rate takes effect on March 4, the same day the postponed 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico come into force.
The _Global Times_ , a sister publication of the state news organization _The People’s Daily_ , 
### **February 27, 2025: Trump threatens an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods**
President Trump announced in a post on his social media platform Truth Social that he will impose an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese imports starting March 4, the date on which the 25 percent tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada will come into effect. In the post, Trump alleged that fentanyl coming into the US from Mexico and Canada is made and supplied by China, implying this is the reason for the tariff hike.
Trump already imposed a 10 percent tariff on all Chinese goods at the beginning of February, meaning the effective tariff rate would increase to 20 percent.
He also stated that the reciprocal tariffs on goods from all countries, announced on February 13, are scheduled to go into effect on April 2.
In a regular press conference on February 28, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian 
Meanwhile, a spokesperson from the Ministry of Commerce 
### **February 21, 2025 – Trump signs a memorandum restricting Chinese investment in the US on national security grounds**
On Friday, Trump signed a 
The memorandum claims that foreign adversaries, including China, “systematically direct and facilitate investment in United States companies and assets to obtain cutting-edge technologies, intellectual property, and leverage in strategic industries”.
The memorandum also calls for establishing new rules to curb US investment in Chinese industries “that advance the PRC’s national Military-Civil Fusion strategy and stop PRC-affiliated persons from buying up critical American businesses and assets”.
In addition to restrictions on investment in strategic industries, the memorandum also calls for restricting the purchase of farmland and real estate near sensitive facilities. According to a White House Fact Sheet, around 2 percent of all US agricultural land is owned by foreign entities and individuals, and China owns more than 350,000 acres of farmland.
In a 
### **February 13, 2025 – Trump signs plan to impose reciprocal tariffs on all trade partners**
Trump signed a 
The “Fair and Reciprocal Plan” will examine non-reciprocal trade relationships with all trade partners, including tariffs on US products, unfair, discriminatory, or extraterritorial taxes on US businesses, workers, and consumers (including VAT), nontariff barriers or measures, including subsidies and regulatory requirements, and policies and practices that cause exchange rates to deviate from their market value.
Examples where the US’s trade partners do not provide reciprocal tariffs on American goods cited in a 
The tariffs that Trump has imposed on products such as steel and aluminum, as well as the 10 percent tariff placed on Chinese goods, would be in addition to the reciprocal tariffs.
The broad scope of the types of duties and trade barriers targeted by the reciprocal action means further tariffs on Chinese goods could be very extensive. The US has in the past accused China of unfairly subsidizing the production of various goods to the detriment of its domestic industries, and China also imposes VAT on most goods and services ranging from six to 13 percent.
In January of this year, the US Trade Representative released the 
It is also likely that the US’s major trading partners, such as the EU, will impose countermeasures on US goods in response to Trump’s actions.
### **February 10, 2025 – Trump states he has spoken to Xi Jinping**
In an 
Trump added that he “loved talking to him” and that they have “a very good personal relationship”.
The Chinese side has not confirmed when or whether the call took place, and the last confirmed communication between the two leaders was 
A White House spokesperson said last week that Trump would speak to Xi Jinping within a few days, but no update has been given on the status of the talks.
### **February 10, 2025 – Trump announces 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports**
On Monday, President Trump signed a 
According to the proclamation, the 25 percent tariff imposed on steel by Trump in 2018 effectively reduced the US’s reliance on imports and increasedthe consumption of domestic supply. However, the proclamation asserts that various exemptions and alternative agreements negotiated with multiple countries and entities during the Trump and Biden administrations have led to imported steel comprising a proportion of US consumption comparable to levels prior to the initial tariff imposition. Additionally, the proclamation states that there is a “global excess capacity crisis” and that increasing Chinese steel exports in recent years is “displacing production in other countries and forcing them to export greater volumes of steel articles and derivative steel articles to the United States.”
As a result, the US will terminate all agreements and exemptions made with different trade partners and entities, and the 25 percent tariff will be reinstated for all steel imports.
Chinese direct exports of steel to the US are very small, accounting for just 0.8 percent of China’s total steel exports in 2024. However, Chinese steel exports to countries that are major sources for steel imports for the US, such as Vietnam and Canada, accounted for 25.22 percent of China’s total steel exports in 2024, according to 
### **February 9, 2025 – Trump announces plan to impose 25% steel and aluminum tariff on all trading partners**
Speaking to  on Air Force One on Sunday, Trump announced he would impose an additional 25 percent tariff on US steel and aluminum imports. The new tariff, which will reportedly be officially announced and take effect on Monday, will be added to all existing duties.
In September 2024, the Biden administration raised the tariff on imports of Chinese steel and aluminum products to 25 percent.
China’s steel and aluminum exports to the US have fallen in recent years and make up a small percentage of China’s overall exports. 
In addition to the steel and aluminum tariff, Trump said he would announce global reciprocal tariffs on Tuesday or Wednesday, which would go into effect immediately.
### **February 7, 2025 – Trump pauses executive action ending de minimis exception**
The Trump administration on Friday released an amendment to an Executive Order deferring the end to the de minimis exception after its sudden implementation on February 4 caused chaos at US logistics centers and customs warehouses. An estimated four million packages entered the US per day in 2024 under the de minimis exception, which allows packages under US$800 in value to forego customs inspections and duties.
The  states that duty-free de minimis treatment will be available on eligible packages until “adequate systems are in place to fully and expediently process and collect tariff revenue”.
On February 4, the US Postal Service also announced a temporary suspension to international packages from the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong but reversed this decision the next day.
### **February 4, 2024 – US Postal Service suspends all parcels arriving from Mainland China and Hong Kong**
In a 
On February 1, Trump signed an Executive Order which, among other actions, halted the de minimis exemption allowing parcels below US$800 in value to bypass customs inspections and duties when entering the US. The stated reason for halting the exemption is to prevent the import of fentanyl and chemical precursors, which arrive in the US via these types of small packages.
The halting of packages from China will severely affect online retailers such as Shein, Temu, and Amazon, as well as countless smaller retail businesses, whose business models are substantially based on exploiting this loophole. It will also have an immediate impact on American consumers, as millions of parcels that have already been shipped will be stuck in customs for an indeterminate amount of time. An analyst told 
### February 4, 2024 – China imposes tariffs on US imports, implements export controls on rare earths in retaliation to Trump’s tariff hike
Shortly after the Trump administration’s 10 percent additional tariff on Chinese imports took effect, China’s Customs Tariff Commission 
These are:
  * A **15 percent tariff** on coal and liquefied natural gas, and
  * A **10 percent tariff** on crude oil, agricultural machinery, large-displacement cars, and pickup trucks.


Additionally, corresponding tariffs will be imposed based on current applicable tariff rates. Existing bonded and tax reduction and exemption policies will remain unchanged, and the additional tariffs will not be reduced or exempted. These tariffs are set to take effect on February 10.
In addition to the tariff increase, China’s Ministry of Commerce and Customs Administration 
The items subject to export controls include various derivations of tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, and molybdenum, critical materials for industries such as electronics, aerospace, and renewable energy.
While the announcement did not explicitly link the export controls to US tariffs, China’s role as one of the largest producers of rare earth metals makes these products a significant bargaining chip in the context of a potential trade war. In an 
Separately, the Trump administration imposed 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico but postponed their implementation by 30 days in both cases following negotiations. However, no such deal has been reached between China and the United States. According to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, Trump is expected to speak with President Xi Jinping “in the next couple of days,” according to 
### February 4, 2024 – China announces an antitrust probe into Google, adds two US companies to the Unreliable Entities List
On Tuesday, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) 
While Google’s search engine has not operated in China since 2011 and its Gmail service ended in 2014, some Google services and products, such as the Google Chrome browser, are still available in the country.
At the same time as the Google antitrust probe announcement, China’s Ministry of Commerce 
According to the Ministry, the two companies “violated normal market trading principles, interrupted normal transactions with Chinese companies, adopted discriminatory measures against Chinese companies, and seriously damaged the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.”
Placement on the Unreliable Entities List subjects these companies to a range of potential penalties, including import and export restrictions, investment limitations, restrictions or prohibitions on company personnel entering China, revocation of work, stay, or residence permits for foreign staff, and fines.
Illumina has expanded its presence in China in recent years, establishing its first manufacturing site in Shanghai in 2022. Meanwhile, PVH Group has seen strong growth in the Chinese market, citing a 20 percent year-on-year increase in revenue in RMB terms in its 2023 Year in Review.
### **February 1, 2025 – Trump signs executive order slapping 10% tariff on Chinese imports**
President Trump signed an executive order (EO) imposing an additional 10 percent tariff on Chinese goods entering the country, ostensibly to curb the import of fentanyl and other illicit substances. Canada and Mexico were separately hit with 25 percent additional tariffs under the same rationale. The additional tariffs will be levied “until the [illicit drug] crisis is alleviated”, according to a 
The Fact Sheet also accused China of failing “to take the actions necessary to stem the flow of precursor chemicals to known criminal cartels and shut down money laundering by transnational criminal organizations”.
Under the Biden administration, the US and China increased collaboration to tackle the export of fentanyl and precursor chemicals from China to the US, launching the US-China Counternarcotics Working Group in January 2024. The initiative was a key part of the efforts to resume US-China cooperation on a variety of issues following years of diplomatic gridlock and, at the time, was viewed as an easy win for the Biden administration. In April 2024, then US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen announced the launch of the Joint Treasury-People’s Bank of China Cooperation and Exchange on Anti-Money Laundering. It is unclear whether these efforts will continue under Trump.
In addition to the tariffs, the EOs also announced a halt to the De Minimis exemption, which exempts parcels valued below US$800 from customs inspections and tariffs. The Trump administration has blamed small packages that fall under this threshold for the illegal import of fentanyl and precursor chemicals.
The suspension of the De Minimis exemption could significantly impact Chinese e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu, which have established vast customer bases in the US. Their business models heavily rely on exploiting this loophole by shipping low-value parcels directly from manufacturers in China to American consumers.
The tariffs will go into effect at 00:01 Eastern Time (13:01 China Standard Time) on Tuesday, February 4.
In response to the tariffs, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson 
### **January 22, 2025 – Trump threatens 10% tariff on China over Fentanyl from Feb 1**
On January 22, 2025, during a White House event, President Donald Trump 
### **January 20, 2025 – Trump’s second term begins with a focus on US-China trade relations**
President Donald Trump marked the start of his second term with a broad trade policy directive, prioritizing a methodical review of the United States’ trade relationships, including a sharp focus on China. While **2020 trade agreement**⟨162⟩ and address trade imbalances.
Key developments include:
  * **Trade memo announcement:** The memo, issued shortly after Trump’s inauguration, directs federal agencies to scrutinize trade deficits and unfair practices by major trading partners, with China being a key focus.
  * **2020 trade deal under review:** Trump’s directive includes assessing China’s compliance with the 2020 deal, which required Beijing to increase purchases of US goods by US$200 billion annually—a commitment largely unmet due to the pandemic.
  * **Avoiding immediate tariffs:** Contrary to campaign rhetoric promising steep tariffs on Chinese imports, the administration appears to be taking a more strategic approach. Analysts suggest this could calm financial markets in the short term.
  * **Universal tariff expected:** Trade experts believe Trump remains committed to imposing a global tariff as part of his economic agenda. The administration is expected to invoke statutes like Section 232 or Section 301 for future trade actions. Trump’s measured approach to tariffs suggests a possible window for negotiations, but the administration’s broader goals—such as pushing China to fulfill its trade commitments—may lead to renewed tensions. The directive reinforces the administration’s intent to hold China accountable for practices perceived as unfair, maintaining pressure in line with Trump’s first-term trade strategy.


This measured start to Trump’s second term reflects his administration’s continued focus on reshaping US-China trade ties, signaling challenges ahead for the bilateral relationship.
###  **January 20, 2025** **– Trump signs executive action to delay the TikTok ban for 75 days**
On January 20, 2025, former President Donald Trump signed an executive order to delay the enforcement of a TikTok ban for an additional 75 days.
Under the terms of the executive order, the U.S. Department of Justice will refrain from enforcing the Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which was passed with broad bipartisan support in Congress and signed into law by former President Joe Biden in April 2024. The Act required TikTok to either sell its U.S. operations to an American or allied buyer or face a ban, effective January 19, 2025.
Prior to his inauguration, Trump had pledged on social media to take executive action to prevent the law from taking effect. Following this announcement, TikTok restored access for existing users after the app had been offline for more than 12 hours from Saturday night to Sunday afternoon.
It remains unclear whether TikTok will be able to continue operating in the U.S. after the 75-day delay. However, the extension provides TikTok’s China-based parent, ByteDance, with additional time to secure a potential buyer for the platform at least.
### **January 20, 2025 – Trump comments on reclaiming the Panama Canal, references manifest destiny for space exploration**
On January 20, 2025, newly inaugurated President Donald Trump stated that the United States would take back control of the Panama Canal. During his inauguration speech, Trump reiterated his accusation that Panama had broken promises made during the 1999 transfer of the canal and had allegedly allowed China to gain influence over its operation. He remarked, “We didn’t give it to China. We gave it to Panama, and we’re taking it back.” Although he did not specify when or how the US would pursue this goal, he previously suggested that military action could be a possibility, a comment that has drawn attention from both supporters and critics.
Trump’s statement on the Panama Canal was part of a wider discussion of his views on US territorial expansion. He invoked the concept of “Manifest Destiny,” historically associated with 19th-century US territorial expansion, and linked it to future goals for space exploration, specifically stating that the US would eventually aim to land astronauts on Mars. Some critics have expressed concerns that such rhetoric might encourage other countries, like Russia and China, to pursue more assertive actions in their respective geopolitical situations. Others have speculated that Trump’s statements may be a strategic move to set a strong negotiating position.
In his speech, Trump also reiterated plans to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America and expressed dissatisfaction with the transfer of the Panama Canal, calling it a “foolish gift.” His administration’s criticisms are based on claims of unfair treatment, particularly regarding shipping costs, though Panama has denied any unfair practices and emphasized that all vessels are treated equally, including those from China. While China does not control the canal itself, a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings manages two ports near the canal’s Caribbean and Pacific entrances, which has been a point of contention in US-China relations.
The Panama Canal is a crucial waterway for both global trade and the US, playing a key role in the transportation of goods from Asia and in the export of US energy resources. Following Trump’s remarks, Panama’s maritime authority announced an audit of the Panama Ports Company, which manages the ports near the canal.
### **January 20, 2025 – Elon Musk and China’s Vice President meet ahead of Trump’s second term**
Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s 
The timing of the meeting, alongside broader discussions with US business leaders, suggests China’s intent to stabilize relations with the US while maintaining economic partnerships. Musk, whose business interests are deeply tied to China, has been described as a potential intermediary between the Trump administration and the Chinese government. This comes amid unresolved tensions over trade and technology, including speculation around Musk’s involvement in a possible TikTok joint venture.
As Trump prepares to recalibrate trade policies, the meeting underscores the critical intersection of business diplomacy and geopolitics in US-China relations.
