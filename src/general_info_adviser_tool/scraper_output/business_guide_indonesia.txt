# Representative Office vs Foreign Limited Liability Company (PT PMA) in Indonesia 
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/company-establishment/representative-office-vs-foreign-limited-liability-company-pt-pma-in-indonesia)
A foreign company planning to setup an office or expand their business in Indonesia has different options that they may consider for their company structure. Choosing the appropriate investment structure for your business depends on several factors, including its planned activities, industry, and investment size.
  

Contributing Advisor
The business entities available to invest in Indonesia are Representative office (RO) and Foreign Limited Liability Company. Both of these types are explained in the Types of Business in Indonesia guide⟨40⟩ and is suggested reading. 
##  At-a-glance: A comparison of the 2 main business entity types in Indonesia, pros and cons, set up requirements, and more.
The differences can be overviewed in the below table. You may also click the FIE structure type in the column header to read further details about each entity.
Comparison: Representative Office vs Foreign Limited Liability Company (PT PMA)  
---  
Foreign Limited Liability Company (PT PMA)⟨93⟩ |  Representative Office⟨94⟩  
Type |  A foreign investment company or PT PMA is the preferred structure for foreign investors looking to have a legal presence in the country. |  Opening a representative office (RO) is the fastest and simplest way of establishing a legal entity in the country. This set up is a temporary arrangement – ROs are not allowed to engage in any commercial activities, issue invoices, sign contracts, or earn any revenue.  
Activities |  There are no restrictions on where the PT PMA can set up in the country, but the business can only focus on one specific sector or area. All applicants will need approval from the Indonesian Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) |  The business activities of ROs are limited to:
  * Market research activities;
  * Obtaining information on potential clients;
  * Developing trade contacts; and
  * Gather information on regulations and laws.

  
Minimum capital requirement |  A total paid-up capital of 10 billion rupiah (US$697,000). (excluding land and properties); |  No minimum capital requirement  
Liabilities |  Liability limited to the company’s assets |  Parent company bears liability for the activities and is responsible for financing operations.  
Tax exemptions |  Can benefit from tax incentives available |  Representative offices are not permitted to generate income and thus are not eligible for tax exemptions.  
Time frame |  4 to 6 weeks |  3 to 5 weeks

# Deregister a company in Indonesia
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/company-establishment/company-dissolution-in-indonesia)
The company dissolution process in Indonesia can require between one and two years or more to complete, can be voluntary or non-voluntary, and can bear liability for members of the board of directors/commissioners in certain circumstances if the company’s assets are insufficient to pay all its obligations.
  

Contributing Advisor
Voluntary dissolution occurs when the owners or investors of the business choose to close the business, due to a variety of reasons from low cash flow to the mismanagement of business operations to excessive company liabilities.
The reasons that a non-voluntary dissolution of a company could occur, include:
  * Court decision to liquidate the company in case the company’s assets are insufficient to settle bankruptcy costs;
  * Revocation of business license;
  * Company dissolution based on a general meeting of shareholders (GMS);
  * Dissolution as mentioned in the company’s Articles of Association; or
  * Bankruptcy assets of a company declared bankrupt are placed in a state of insolvency.


## What are the procedures for closing a limited liability company?
### Dissolution proposal
The first stage of the dissolution of a limited liability company begins by preparing the dissolution proposal. Under voluntary dissolution the proposal is prepared through a GMS meeting. The decision. of the GMS will depend on the provisions of the quorum, which are stipulated on the deed of incorporation. Unless the incorporation document specifies otherwise, three-quarters of the quorum must be in agreement before the dissolution can be carried out.
Under the non-voluntary process, an authority intervention (usually by court order) will initiate the dissolution proposal.
#### Appointment of a liquidator
The GMS or court order will appoint a liquidator in the next stage of the dissolution process, depending on if the dissolution process was voluntary or non-voluntary.
In most cases, the liquidators are the directors of the company, but some may appoint lawyers from outside the company to act as liquidators to avoid any conflict of interest. The liquidator’s responsibilities include:
  * Record and announce the company’s assets;
  * Make payments to creditors;
  * Make payments of the remaining assets to shareholders;
  * Reporting to the tax office so that the company’s tax number can be revoked;
  * Announce the planned division of assets in the State Gazette of the Republic of Indonesia; and
  * Other actions for the implementation of the settlement of assets.


The final report of the liquidator is then reported to the GMS or the court for approval. The aim for publishing the dissolution in the State Gazette is to inform all creditors as well as the Ministry of Law and Human Rights (MLOHR).
The announcement must be published within 30 days after the decision to dissolve the company was taken and the creditors must claim any outstanding debts during the 60 days following the announcement of the dissolution in the State Gazette.
The court also has the right to auction the company’s assets to be used to cover any debts held.
### Responsibility relief of the liquidator
A third GMS is usually held to relieve the liquidator of their responsibilities. The MOLHR will then announce the termination of the company’s legal status in the State Gazette.
Limited liability companies should also apply to the Investment Coordinating Board to revoke its business license.
### What is the time frame for the dissolution of the company?
The dissolution process could take at least 12 months to up to two years from the date of approval of the GMS. This is with the assumption that all rights and obligations of the company to third parties are fulfilled.
### Are directors personally liable for company debts?
If the company goes bankrupt due to negligence or error caused by the directors or commissioners, and if the company’s assets are insufficient to pay all the obligations, then each member of the board of directors/commissioners are jointly responsible for any outstanding obligations.
Important Tip
If the dissolution of the company was not caused by the negligence of the directors or commissioners, then they are not liable for the company’s debts.

## Dissolution of a Representative Office
In order to end the existence of a representative office (RO), a simple de-registration in itself will be needed. Unlike a limited liability company, a RO does not undergo the process of liquidation and thus closing this entity is a much simpler process.
Although an RO does not engage in direct sales, and therefore does not generate revenue or profit, it is still a taxable entity in Indonesia. An RO is therefore obligated to report and pay taxes and social security (income tax will be zero).
A required step in the deregistration process for an RO therefore, is for the RO to notify the tax office to delete its tax number. Until and unless an Ros tax number is officially deleted, the RO must continue to provide tax reports.

## Procedure for opening a corporate bank account
The procedure of opening a corporate account is as follows:
  * Send all the required documents (see above section) to the bank, noting your company's intention to open a bank account, for their review;
  * After sending all the aforementioned documents to the bank, the bank will send a Board Resolution back to you, which is a document that states the appointment of the authorized person to open, operate, maintain, appoint account signatory(ies), and close the bank account.
  * This Bank Resolution document must be signed by the applicant and sent back to the bank for their review via email;
  * The bank will send the account opening form to be filled by the Company;
  * Once the account opening form is completed, scan and send it back to the Bank for their review;
  * If the bank review finds all the documents are in order, then the process of opening the account will take no longer than one working day. 
    1. The bank will need the company to send all original signed documents (Board Resolution and Account Opening Form) to the Bank for their records;
    2. The company must make an initial deposit of no less than 100 million rupiah (US$6,929) for each account; 
      1. The Company can have as many accounts with different currencies according to their needs but must have the equivalent of the minimum deposit.
      2. If there are no transactions within 6 months, the account will be deactivated automatically.
  * Apply for internet banking and other banking services, if needed.

## Common types of bank accounts
There are three common types of bank accounts, these are:
  * Checking account – Payments can be made through cheques or demand deposit (GIRO);
  * Savings account – The most frequently used account that allows for real-time transfers; and
  * Deposit account – Offers higher interest rates and the deposits can only be withdrawn based on an agreement with the bank.


Most Indonesian banks offer both rupiah and foreign currency saving accounts such as for US Dollar, Singapore Dollar, Japanese Yen, Euro, Hong Kong Dollar, Swiss Franc, and the Australian Dollar. The most common foreign currency used by businesses in Indonesia is the US Dollar.
### Banking fees
Most banks in Indonesia will have a monthly administrative fee ranging from 12,500 rupiah (US$0.84) to 15,000 rupiah (US$1) per month. This is dependent on the type of account. Most banks will allow free cash withdrawals at their ATMs, although there is normally a charge for using another bank’s ATM of up to 6,500 rupiah (US$0.44) per transaction.
## Major Indonesian banking institution
  * Bank Mandiri;
  * Bank Central Asia; and
  * Bank Negara Indonesia.


## Common international banks in Indonesia
  * Bank of America;
  * Bank of China;
  * Deutsche Bank; and
  * JPMorgan Chase.


Opening bank accounts in Indonesia can be a relatively quick and smooth process, if all necessary documents are prepared and the other requirements are met. For newly establishing companies, a helpful prerequisite is for your incorporation process to be well managed and at the right step.

# Exploring Opportunities in Indonesia without an Entity
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/company-establishment/peo-setup-without-an-office)
## The Benefits of a Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Service
When it comes to employing people to run your business in a foreign country like Indonesia, the traditional approach has been to establish a fully operational company that complies with HR, tax, and other regulations. However, the process of setting up a company in Indonesia can take several months. During this time, the intended company remains non-operational, incurring significant running costs and requiring substantial investment capital. This approach also means that the investing company may not fully understand the business, financial landscape, consumer preferences, or local culture of the foreign market.
  

Contributing Advisor
This fixed market entry strategy can lead to avoidable mistakes such as:
  * Choosing the wrong pricing model
  * Launching an unsuitable initial service line or product
  * Setting up in an unfavorable location
  * Pursuing a misguided business model, or
  * Partnering with the wrong business associates or suppliers.


Without on-the-ground information and practical experience, these mistakes can occur easily. However, rectifying such errors after investments have been made is costly, time-consuming, and can even damage the business' reputation.
Considering these challenges, an increasing number of firms today are opting for a more prudent approach, initially testing or targeting a smaller or shorter-term presence in Indonesia - allowing businesses to mitigate risks and gain valuable market insights before making significant commitments.
A lesser-known model for businesses to hedge against the risks of market entry is available across several Asian markets. 
Did You Know
As an alternative, a new market entry model called Global Staffing enables foreign investors to do business in Indonesia for short-term durations without having a legal entity of their own.
## Understanding Global staffing solutions and PEO: How does it work? 
Global Staffing Solutions (GSS) is a market entry strategy and suite of services that can make it easier for businesses to operate internationally. Key within the GSS suite, is Professional Employer Organization ("PEO") service. 
A Professional Employer Organization (PEO) is a third-party service provider that acts as an employer of record for a business, managing all human resource-related functions, including payroll, benefits, and compliance with labor laws. By partnering with a PEO, investors can engage local employees and navigate the intricacies of employment in Indonesia, without the need to establish a legal entity.
This results in a local firm taking on the burden of day-to-day employee HR management, payroll, and tax compliance, freeing up your critical resources so that you, as an international firm, can focus on your business and explore your options in a new or unfamiliar market. 
This means that, while the overseas company and its outsourced hires will maintain normal day-to-day control and working employee relationships, the local service provider in Indonesia will handle all the risk mitigation, compliance, payroll, and benefits on the ground. 
## Advantages of adopting a global staffing solutions strategy 
Foreign companies can benefit from the GSS service by hiring full-time employees to work in overseas markets while remaining compliant with local laws, without the time and investment required to set up and operate an overseas legal entity. 
It can specifically provide the following advantages to businesses. 
### Local expertise and support
By partnering with a PEO service provider, investors gain access to a team of local experts who possess extensive knowledge of the Indonesian market. These professionals can provide guidance and support on various aspects, including recruitment, employee relations, cultural nuances, and market insights. This local expertise can be invaluable for businesses seeking to make informed decisions and navigate the unique challenges of operating in Indonesia.
### Employing staff at local labor costs 
Through GSS, the foreign company can easily hire employees at reasonable local wages, which avoid unnecessary costs due to lack of knowledge of local wage standards and wrong estimation of manpower budget. 
It also gives the opportunity to the foreign investor to test the local person and assess suitability for a hire under a local permanent structure or, determine what additional skillset the “first” employee of the company should possess to deliver results in the country. 
### Outsourced employee management 
Due to the labor relationship between the employees and local provider, the HR team can assist the foreign employer with its salary calculations, social insurance contributions, individual income tax (IIT) declarations, and reimbursements for their local employees. The GSS service frees the foreign company from day-to-day HR and administration, so that it can concentrate on its business activities. 
### Hiring employees in compliance with labor laws
Navigating the complex labor regulations and compliance standards of a foreign country can be a daunting task. Fortunately, partnering with a PEO in Indonesia can help investors mitigate this challenge. A reputable PEO service provider will possess an in-depth understanding of local labor laws and regulations, ensuring that businesses operate in full compliance with all legal requirements, minimizing the risk of penalties and legal complications.
Quite a few foreigners and local staff continue to be hired “off the books” in Indonesia and are sent money from the overseas company directly into their local bank account. This is risky from a legal compliance perspective as there is no local social contribution or taxes paid. Moreover, it also does not provide the overseas investor with any leverage or legal control over such asset on the ground. 
Under a GSS strategy, the local provider can ensure that the foreign employee remains compliant within Indonesia’s law and regulations, and proactively assist with the foreign employee’s visa and work permit application, setting up a bank account, as well as their IIT verification in Indonesia. 
This has the added benefit of mitigating many of the legal and practical problems that arise when a payment is made into an employee’s overseas private bank account. With a GSS structure in place, the foreign employee can instead receive money directly from the local company to their local bank account in Indonesia. 
### Getting legal support on labor contract issues 
Finally, the legal team in Indonesia can also assist with the establishment and determination of labor contracts with employees, according to the local labor laws. 
### Flexibility in the working relationship 
Foreign companies are able to terminate the local working relationship at limited cost if there is a mismatch in skillsets or expectation. In the same vein, they can easily scale-up their staffing solution if the working relationship is proven successful. 
## Accessing the Indonesian market with ease: Versatile applications for a global staffing solutions model
Traditionally, a successful market entry strategy requires consideration to timing, scale relative to competition, and the ability to leverage complementary assets. However, in this new age of doing business, operational agility has now emerged as a key determinant of success. 
In this way, businesses should be prepared to rapidly respond and adapt to changes in the market and environment in both productive and cost-effective ways. In terms of designing a market-entry strategy, this indicates a shifting focus to different markets, quickly and with minimal costs and risks. 
Did You Know
Services, like Global Staffing Solutions, empower foreign firms with the ability to look at alternatives within a specific sector and try out different strategies or even markets in Asia to plan against supply chain disruptions and establish sustainable long-term operations.
More broadly, GSS provides an effective market entry strategy for companies looking to expand into fast-developing countries within Asia, such as Vietnam, Singapore, and Indonesia. 
Investors can use this in a new market to gain first-hand knowledge of the local business environment and culture – to determine market suitability and formulate an appropriate entry strategy. 
Uncertainty is an inevitable factor of doing business in any economic climate. Yet, recent black swan events like the COVID-19 pandemic illustrates is that, now more than ever, businesses need to plan for the unexpected – disrupted global supply chains, destabilized economies, and / or mass lay-offs. 
One of the key advantages of utilizing a PEO service is the flexibility it offers to investors. Businesses can quickly scale their operations up or down, depending on market conditions and business requirements, without the hassle of restructuring or downsizing. This level of flexibility allows investors to adapt and respond to changing market dynamics swiftly, ensuring agility in their Indonesian business operations.

# Intellectual Property Protection in Indonesia
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/company-establishment/intellectual-property-protection)
Indonesia has ratified various international agreements on intellectual property rights such as the Madrid Protocol, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, the Berne Convention, the Paris Convention, and the WIPO Copyright Treaty.
  

Contributing Advisor
Indonesia is also a signatory to the ASEAN Patent Examination Cooperation, which can allow applicants to obtain patents in and across other participating ASEAN countries, faster and more efficiently.
## What are the main types of intellectual property that are protected under Indonesian laws?
The following types of intellectual property are protected:
  * Trademarks⟨93⟩;
  * Patents⟨94⟩; and
  * Copyrights⟨95⟩.


## Trademarks
As this section explains in detail, the Indonesia trademark regime adopts the first-to-file principal, trademark applications made face substantive examination and must meet other criteria to be successful. Trademark registrations can require between 3 and 6 months, be valid up to 10 years, and can later be renewed within 6 months of the expiry date.
### Trademark applications
Under Indonesia’s Trademark Law, a trademark is defined as any sign in the form of letters, numbers, compositions, symbols, figures, colors, or a combination of the aforementioned that is used to distinguish the goods and services provided by a company or person. Sounds, holograms, and 3-dimensional forms can also be protected under the law.t
As mentioned, Indonesia adopts the first-to-file principal, meaning that the entity or individual whose trademark application has the earliest filing date will hold the rights exclusively.
Furthermore, a trademark application can be rejected if it is filed in bad faith (it appears to be substantially similar to an already registered trademark) as well as contravening, the State Ideology, religion, current laws and regulations, and public order. The trademark application should also not be misleading in terms of its quality, type, size, or intended use.

### Substantive examination
Once an application is put through to the Directorate General of Intellectual Property Rights (DGIP), the DGIP will undertake a formality check before publishing the application for a period of two months. During this time, any interested party can challenge the application.

After the publication period ends, the DGIP will undertake a substantive examination by appointing an examiner from the Ministry of Law and Human Rights. This process takes approximately 30 days if there is no opposition, or 90 days if an opposition is filed.
It should be noted that a trademark application can be rejected if it is filed in bad faith (it appears to be substantially similar to an already registered trademark) as well as contravening, the State Ideology, religion, current laws and regulations, and public order. The trademark application should also not be misleading in terms of its quality, type, size, or intended use.
### Certification
If the application passes the examination, the DGIP will issue a certificate and publish the trademark on the official Trademark Gazette. The trademark will expire 10 years from the original filing date. This can be renewed within 6 months of the expiry date.
### Enforcement
A proprietor of a registered trademark can file a lawsuit to the Commercial Court if a third party is found to be misusing the trademark.
Under Indonesia’s Criminal Code, if the third party is found guilty of using an identical trademark to a registered one, they can receive prison terms of up to four years or a maximum fine of up to 500 million rupiah (US$612,800).
Did You Know
If the mark used by the third party is similar in terms of its basic elements to the registered trademark, then the infringer is subject to fines of up to 2 billion rupiah (US$134,277).
## Patents
Patents in Indonesia are regulated under the Patent Law which defines a patent as an exclusive right granted to an inventor for an invention that is novel.
There are two types of patents for technical inventions in Indonesia:
  * Patents – applied to novel inventions, involves and inventive step, and can be applied to industries. This form of protection is for goods and processes; and
  * Simple patents – this is granted to new inventions that are industrially applicable but does not involve and inventive step. As such, this can be applied to inventions that improve existing products.


A patent is granted for a period of 20 years and 10 years for simple patents. Patent implementation includes the importing, making, and licensing of a patented product.
### Substantive examination
The DGIP conducts a substantive examination of all patent applications through qualified patent examiners. The application will also be published on the official Patent Gazette which is open to the public who can submit any objections to the relevant patent. This process approximately takes 18 months from the date of receipt of the application.
### Certification
The DGIP will approve or refuse a patent application within 30 months from the request date. Simple patents are normally approved within 10 months.
If the results of the substantive examination are in-line with the Patent Law, then the DGIP will issue a patent certificate.
### Enforcement
Any unauthorized use of a patent can result in a fine of up to 1 billion rupiah (US$67,116) and infringements of simple patents 500 million rupiah (US$33,554).
## Copyrights
Copyright is defined as the exclusive right of an author in the field of science, literature, and art. The types of work protected by the law are:
  * Books, literary works, pamphlets;
  * Speeches, public talks, and other similar works;
  * Songs or music made with or without lyrics;
  * Maps;
  * Batik art;
  * Photographic works;
  * Cinematographic works;
  * Portraits;
  * Architectural works;
  * Fine art such as paintings, drawings, engravings, calligraphy;
  * Translations, adaptations;
  * Computer programs; and
  * Video games.


### Registering the copyright
Since Indonesia is a member of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, copyright protection is afforded automatically. Moreover, the works of foreign nationals will also be automatically protected in Indonesia.
Although copyright registration is not necessary, it is beneficial for artists to file the copyright to the DGIP to validate the protection of the work.
### Length of the copyright protection
Copyright protection continues throughout the lifetime of the author and an additional 70 years after their death. If the work is owned by a legal entity, then the copyright protection is given throughout the lifetime of the author and 50 years after their death.
If the works are owned by multiple people, then the copyright is valid until the longest surviving author. This is extended by an additional 70 years after the death of the longest surviving author.
For computer games, photographic works, databases, and cinematographic works, the copyright protection lasts for 70 years.
### Enforcement
A copyright owner can file a lawsuit through the Criminal Courts which can stop the infringement of the copyright from continuing. The infringer can be fined between 100 million rupiah (US$6,717) to 4 billion rupiah (US$268,290) or imprisonment of between one to 10 years.

# Employment and Labor Laws in Indonesia
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/human-resources-and-payroll/labor-law)
The main sources of employment and labor laws in Indonesia are:
  

Contributing Advisor
  * Labor Law of 2003 on Manpower as recently amended by Law No. 11 of 2020 on Job Creation and recently revoked by Government Regulation in Lieu of Law No. 2 of 2022 on Job Creation;
  * Law No. 21 of 2000 on Labor Union; and
  * Law No. 2 of 2004 on Industrial Relations Dispute Settlement.


The labor law regulates all employment in Indonesia. Employers must fulfil the following rights for employees:
  * Receive the minimum wage, this varies depending on sector and province;
  * Receive social security, which includes pension, healthcare, life insurance, accident insurance, and old-age benefits;
  * Receive religious holiday allowance (1 month’s salary - subject to the period of employment)
  * Receive statutory absence or payment when the employee does not take annual leave; and
  * Receive payment for overtime.


## Fixed term contracts
The government recognizes three types of fixed-term contracts (FTC):
  * FTC based on the completion of work;
  * FTC based on the period of time; and
  * FTC related to non-permanent work.


All FTC types are for work that is temporary and can be completed within a set time period, therefore any contract extensions cannot be for prolonged periods (5 years maximum in total). Failing to adhere to these rules will result in the employee being deemed to be on a permanent employment contract.
Indonesia’s New Fixed-Term Contract System  
---  
FTC based on completion of work |  FTC base on period |  FTC related to non-permanent work  
Type of work | 
  * Temporary work; or
  * One-time work

| 
  * Work that can be completed in a short time;
  * Seasonal work; or
  * Work related to new products that are in trial or experimentation.

| 
  * Work that is based on attendance; or
  * Work that changes based on volume or time.

  
Contract period |  There is no specific maximum period, however, the employment agreement must include provisions on the expected period for work completion. |  Maximum five years (including extension). |  Maximum 20 days per month. If the employee works for 21 days per month or more for three consecutive months, then they will be considered permanent workers.  
### Compensation for FTC workers
The employer is obligated to pay compensation to the employee, even if the employee terminates the FTC prematurely.
The employers must pay compensation upon:
  * The expiry of an FTC;
  * Each extension of the FTC; and
  * Early termination of the contract, irrespective of who terminates the contract.


 Related Resource⟨93⟩ Indonesia’s Omnibus Law: The New Unemployment Benefit Program⟨93⟩
### How is it calculated?
Compensation is calculated using the following formula:
Contract period |  Compensation amount  
---|---  
More than one month but less than 12 months |  (work period in months/12) x one month’s salary  
More than 12 months  
12 consecutive months |  One month’s salary  
When an FTC expires and is then extended, the compensation for the initial contract must be paid when the FTC expires.
Important Tip
For any ongoing FTCs, the compensation payment will be calculated from November 2, 2020, the date from which the Omnibus Law came into effect. Further, foreign workers are not entitled to the aforementioned compensation.
## Minimum wages
Calculations for the monthly minimum wage are carried out by the provincial or district wage council. The local government will determine the minimum wage based on economic and employment conditions. These comprise of the following variables:
  * Purchasing power parity;
  * Manpower absorption levels; and
  * Median wage variables (the margin between 50 percent of the highest wages and 50 percent from the lowest 50 percent of the lowest wages from employees in the same position).


## Working hours
Normal working hours in Indonesia are 40 hours per week, which can be divided into eight hours per day for five working days or seven hours per day for six working days.
Working hours of less than 40 hours per week are recognized if the company has the following characteristics:
  * Undertake work that can be completed in less than 35 hours per week;
  * Can implement flexible working hours; and
  * Undertake work that can be completed outside a particular location.


### Overtime
The regulation extends the overtime working hours to four hours per day and 18 hours per week, which does not apply to public holidays.
The collective labor agreements, company regulations, or employment agreements should specifically state which roles are entitled to overtime pay. If this is not expressed, then the employee will automatically be entitled to receive this payment.
The regulation does include provisions for employees who are exempt from overtime pay eligibility. These are:
  * Employees that hold certain positions with responsibilities as thinkers, controllers, planners, executors, etc.;
  * Workers whose working hours cannot be capped, such as those in managerial roles; and
  * Workers that are paid high salaries.

## Outsourcing
The new regulation makes it clear for employers to include the provisions of transfer of rights protection in the contract in the event of a change in an outsourcing company. The outsourcing company must be a legal entity and comply with the business license they were issued from the central government.
## Hiring foreign workers
For a local company to employ a foreign worker, they must prepare a Foreign Worker Utilization Plan (Rencana Penggunaan Tenaga Kerja Asing (RPTKA)) — a document that details the specific work, position, and length of employment the foreign employee will undertake in Indonesia.

The RPTKA now also serves as the basis for the MOM to grant visas and stay permits.
It is the responsibility of the local company to apply for the RPTKA, which can be done through the online portal, under the Ministry of Manpower. The application is addressed to the Director of Foreign Manpower Utilization Management (Direktur Pengendalian Penggunaan Tenaga Kerja Asing).

## Termination of employment
The employer must first notify the employee in writing, setting out the reasons for termination, and the termination payments and entitlements at least 14 business days before the date of termination.
If the employee has no objection to the termination, then the employer can notify the Ministry of Manpower of this notice. If, however, the employee objects to the termination, they must provide, in writing, the reasons for this within seven business days of receiving the termination notice.

# A Guide to Hiring in Indonesia
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/human-resources-and-payroll/a-guide-to-hiring-in-indonesia)
Companies must adhere to the Manpower Law when hiring local employees as it regulates the rights and obligations between employers and employees.
  

Contributing Advisor
## Formal offer letter
Once a company has agreed to hire a candidate, they will need to send an official offer letter, which sets out the clear expectations of both parties. The letter should include:
  * The candidates’ job position;
  * Salary and benefits;
  * Starting date;
  * Job description; and
  * Type of contract.


## Fixed-term contracts
There are three types of fixed-term contracts (FTC):
  * FTC based on the completion of work;
  * FTC based on the period of time; and
  * FTC related to non-permanent work.


All FTC types are for work that is temporary and can be completed within a set time period, therefore any contract extensions cannot be for prolonged periods (five years maximum in total). Failing to adhere to these rules will result in the employee being deemed to be on a permanent employment contract.
Indonesia’s New Fixed-Term Contract System  
---  
FTC based on completion of work |  FTC base on period |  FTC related to non-permanent work  
Type of work | 
  * Temporary work; or
  * One-time work

| 
  * Work that can be completed in a short time;
  * Seasonal work; or
  * Work related to new products that are in trial or experimentation.

| 
  * Work that is based on attendance; or
  * Work that changes based on volume or time.

  
Contract period |  There is no specific maximum period, however, the employment agreement must include provisions on the expected period for work completion. |  Maximum five years (including extension). |  Maximum 20 days per month. If the employee works for 21 days per month or more for three consecutive months, then they will be considered permanent workers.  
### Compensation for FTC workers
The employer is obligated to pay compensation to the employee even if the employee terminates the FTC prematurely.
The employers must pay compensation upon:
  * The expiry of an FTC;
  * Each extension of the FTC; and
  * Early termination of the contract, irrespective of who terminates the contract.


#### How is it calculated?
Compensation is calculated using the following formula:
Contract period |  Compensation amount  
---|---  
More than one month but less than 12 months |  (work period in months/12) x one month’s salary  
More than 12 months  
12 consecutive months |  One month’s salary  
When an FTC expires and is then extended, the compensation for the initial contract must be paid when the FTC expires.
For any ongoing FTCs, the compensation payment will be calculated from November 2, 2020. Further, foreign workers are not entitled to the aforementioned compensation.
## Working hours
Normal working hours in Indonesia are 40 hours per week, which can be divided into eight hours per day for five working days or seven hours per day for six working days.
Working hours of less than 40 hours per week are recognized if the company has the following characteristics:
  * Undertake work that can be completed in less than 35 hours per week;
  * Can implement flexible working hours; and
  * Undertake work that can be completed outside a particular location.


### Overtime
The regulation extends the overtime working hours to four hours per day and 18 hours per week, which does not apply to public holidays. Collective labor agreements, company regulations, or employment agreements should specifically state which roles are entitled to overtime pay. If this is not expressed, then the employee will automatically be entitled to receive this payment.

The overtime payment is based on the employee’s monthly wage. Every hour, the calculation is applied, which is 1/173 times the monthly wage.
The calculation of the overtime payment is also categorized by the day of the overtime: working days, weekends, or public holidays. The regulation does include provisions on employees that are exempt from overtime pay eligibility. These are:
  * Employees that hold certain positions with responsibilities as thinkers, controllers, planners, executors, etc.;
  * Workers whose working hours cannot be capped, such as those in managerial roles; and
  * Workers that are paid high salaries.


 Read more⟨64⟩ For more information on working hours and overtime read our full guide to Minimum wages.⟨64⟩
## Outsourcing
Employers must include the provisions of transfer of rights protection in the contract in the event of a change in an outsourcing company. The outsourcing company must be a legal entity and comply with the business license they were issued from the central government.
## Hiring foreign workers
For a local company to employ a foreign worker, they must prepare a Foreign Worker Utilization Plan (Rencana Penggunaan Tenaga Kerja Asing (RPTKA)) — a document that details the specific work, position, and length of employment the foreign employee will undertake in Indonesia. The RPTKA now also serves as the basis for the MOM to grant visas and stay permits.

## Obligations for companies when hiring in Indonesia
### Employer compliance obligations
Income tax in Indonesia is mostly paid by withholding by the employer. The tax withheld by employers must be remitted to the government body every month.
### Employee compliance obligations
Expatriate employees are required to complete an annual tax return and compute their tax liability by March 31 of the following tax year.
The majority of PIT is paid through statutory employer withholdings on earned income. However, for any other income that a taxpayer in Indonesia earns regularly, they must make monthly provisional tax payments to the tax department based on the income earned in the previous year.
### Healthcare and Social Security
Indonesia’s social security programs are run by two organizations – the Social Security Administrator for Health (BPJS Kesehatan) for healthcare and the Workers Social Security (BPJS Ketenagakerjaan) for socio-economic protection. 
Did You Know
The premium for employees is calculated as five percent of the monthly salary, with a salary cap of 12 million rupiah (US$722). 
In the private sector, the employer must pay four percent and the employee the remaining one percent. For civil servants, the government contributes three percent while the employee contributes two percent.
The BPJS ketenagakerjaan's program covers the following:
  * Work compensation – provides protection for accidents occurring during or as a result of work;
  * Old age benefits – provides protection for participants that are in retirement, laid off;
  * Pension benefits – provides guaranteed income in retirement; and
  * Life insurance – upon the death of the participant, their heirs can claim the benefits.

## Public holidays and annual leaves
Indonesia’s government entitles its citizens to some public holidays. In addition to official public holidays, the government also provides joint leaves (collective leave days). The Manpower Law entitles all employees to 12 days of annual leave per year.

# Human Resources and Payroll
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/human-resources-and-payroll)
Indonesia boasts a 137 million strong workforce, accounting for 50 percent of the total population – ranking behind only China, India, and the USA.
  

Contributing Advisor
Add to its large working population providing potential employers with several talent options, and a young workforce with a median age of 28 - the competitive cost of living and minimum wages make Indonesia an ideal choice for business.
However, Indonesia’s recently promulgated Job Creation law, aimed at reforming the labor landscape in Indonesia, has amended several labor requirements significantly. Changes include a formula for calculating the minimum wage, eliminating sectoral minimum wages, introducing provisions for hourly wages (for the first time), and income support for workers made redundant. A new procedure for the disbursal of severance payments has also been established.
A firm understanding of Indonesia’s laws and regulations related to human resources and payroll management is essential for foreign investors who want to establish or are already running foreign-invested entities in the country.
In this section, we discuss:
  * Indonesia’s labor laws;
  * Hiring employees;
  * Business visas and employment permits;
  * Minimum wages;
  * Terminating employees;
  * Social insurance; and
  * Public holidays and leave allowances.


### Employment and labor laws in Indonesia
The main sources of employment and labor laws in Indonesia are:
  * Labor Law of 2003 on Manpower as amended by Law No. 11 of 2020 on Job Creation and recently revoked by Government Regulation in Lieu of Law No. 2 of 2022 on Job Creation;
  * Law No. 21 of 2000 on Labor Union; and
  * Law No. 2 of 2004 on Industrial Relations Dispute Settlement.


In general, an employer must fulfill the following rights for employees:
  * Receive the minimum wage, this varies depending on sector and province;
  * Receive social security, which includes pension, healthcare, life insurance, accident insurance, and old age benefits;
  * Receive religious holiday allowance (1 month’s salary - subject to the period of employment);
  * Receive statutory absence or payment when the employee does not take annual leave; and
  * Receive payment for overtime.


Indonesia’s new Job Creation Law, or the Omnibus law, has also made changes to fixed-term contracts in order to better organize the labor pool in Indonesia that foreign companies must understand when hiring in Indonesia.

## Hiring employees in Indonesia
All employment in Indonesia must be through a contract, which may either be indefinite term or fixed term contracts. The contract must specify the obligations of the employers and employees – such as compensation, benefits, termination clauses, severance, and more.
While hiring foreign workers in Indonesia has been simplified under the job creation law, businesses can only hire foreign workers under certain criteria. Companies need to check whether the sector they operate in is allowed to hire foreign workers. 
Regulation No. 8 of 2021 (MOM Reg 8/2021) on the Employment of Foreign Workers issued by Indonesia’s Ministry of Manpower provides detailed requirements for businesses to fulfill in order to hire foreign workers.

For a local company to employ a foreign worker, they must prepare a Foreign Worker Utilization Plan (Rencana Penggunaan Tenaga Kerja Asing (RPTKA)) — a document that details the specific work, position, and length of employment the foreign employee will undertake in Indonesia. The RPTKA now also serves as the basis for the MOM to grant visas and stay permits.

### Business visas and employment permits
There are several visas foreign visitors can apply for depending on their purpose of visit. This includes:
  * Single entry business visas;
  * Multiple entry business visas;
  * Work visa (IMTA);
  * Limited stay visa (VITAS);
  * Permanent stay visa (KITAP);
  * Social visit visas; and
  * Second home visa.


The Indonesia business visa is provided to foreigners who wish to attend meetings, and conferences, sign a contract, or engage in any other business-related activity in Indonesia. These visas, however, do not entitle you to work for an Indonesian employer.
Further, to better define the permitted position for expatriates in Indonesia, Indonesia’s Ministry of Labor issued Regulation No. 228 of 2019 (Reg 228, 2019). The new regulation widens the number of positions open to expatriate workers, consolidates the list of positions into one, and simplifies the approval process for foreigners and their employers. Other changes have also been made to the immigration laws under the new Omnibus Law.

### Minimum wages in Indonesia
In Indonesia, the minimum wage applies to all workers with less than one year of working in the company. After one year, the employee is eligible to be paid in accordance with the scale of wages in the particular company, if they wish to do so.
The local government will determine the minimum wage based on economic and employment conditions. These comprise of the following variables:
  * Purchasing power parity;
  * Manpower absorption levels; and
  * Median wage variables (the margin between 50 percent of the highest wages and 50 percent from the lowest 50 percent of the lowest wages from employees in the same position).


These variables are assessed based on existing data from the last three years. In addition, the wage council will also take into account economic growth or provision rate inflation, as well as the per capita consumption of working household members. If the provincial, regional, or city minimum wage is currently higher than the sectoral minimum wage, then businesses will have to apply the provincial, regional, or city minimum wage.
Did You Know?
Under Government Regulation 37 of 2021 (GR 37/2021), the government has introduced a new unemployment benefit program Job Loss Security Program (JLS), — the first of its kind in the country.
As the minimum wage for each province differs, foreign investors should seek the help of registered local advisors to help understand how changes will affect their operations.

### Terminating employees
Indonesia’s Omnibus Law has made significant changes to the country’s employment laws, most notably on employee termination.
Prior to the changes in the Omnibus Law, employers had no right to unilaterally terminate employment in any circumstance, unless the termination was agreed upon by both parties through negotiations. The employer would then be able to obtain approval for the termination from the labor courts and the employee was entitled to up to six months’ salary.
Under the latest changes, the employer can now notify the employee in writing, setting out the reasons for termination, and the termination payments and entitlements at least 14 business days before the date of termination.

## Payroll in Indonesia
When handling payroll in Indonesia, employers must adhere to strict guidelines. Employers must withhold tax payments and social security contributions from each pay cycle to ensure payroll compliance.
### Social insurance in Indonesia
The government has made it mandatory for all Indonesian citizens and expatriates to participate in the social security programs. Expat employees must also enroll their families in the programs.
Indonesia’s social security programs are run by two organizations – the Social Security Administrator for Health (BPJS Kesehatan) for healthcare and the Social Security Administrator for Employment (BPJS Ketenagakerjaan) for socio-economic protection.
The government launched its ambitious universal healthcare and pension programs in 2014. Since its inception, the healthcare program has become the biggest in the world with more than 185 million participants. Registered Indonesians and expatriates are eligible for free health services ranging from dental care to medicines to physiotherapy. Further, patients are also eligible for free emergency and chronic care, in addition to organ transplants.
Below is a list of social security contributions and rates:
Types of Social Security |  Contribution (as a % of regular monthly salary/wages) |  Remark  
---|---|---  
Borne by employer |  Borne by employee  
Health Security |  4% |  1% |  Up to a maximum monthly salary of IDR 12 million. An employee’s monthly salary includes wages plus all fixed employment benefits.  
Work Accident Security (Jaminan Kecelakaan Kerja or “JKK”) |

### Individual Income Tax in Indonesia
An individual’s income is subject to 5% to 35% of progressive income tax rates.
Expatriate workers need to know that personal income tax (PIT) in Indonesia is determined through a self-assessment scheme.
The country has adopted a worldwide income taxation system, meaning that individuals considered Indonesian tax residents must pay tax to the government on the income they earned in Indonesia, and also on income they earned from abroad, unless there is an applicable double tax agreement.
Non-resident taxpayers will only be liable to pay PIT for income they earn in Indonesia unless the country in which they are a tax resident has an applicable tax treaty with Indonesia. In these cases, the taxpayer might not pay any tax in Indonesia or pay a reduced amount.
Did You Know
Effective fiscal year 2022, the lowest tax bracket cap for individual income tax will be increased from IDR 50 million to IDR 60 million and a new 35% tax bracket will be added for individuals earning more than IDR 5 billion annually.
Given these tax treatments, it is important for expatriate workers to understand their tax liabilities in Indonesia. It is advisable to use the services of registered local tax advisors to help determine which tax law regime will be applicable along with any exemptions that may be brought.

### Public holidays
Indonesia’s government entitles its citizens to some public holidays. In addition to official public holidays, the government also provides joint leaves (collective leave days).
Further, Indonesia’s Ministry of Manpower issued 
The THR is a yearly bonus given to employees at least one week before the start of the religious holiday observed by the employee (based on the employee’s religion), equivalent to one month’s salary (based on the period of employment).
Further, the Manpower Law entitles all employees to 12 days of annual leave per year and establishes the guidelines for maternity leave, paternity leave, as well as sick leave.

# Complete Guide to Business Registration Number in Indonesia 
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/company-establishment/business-registration-number-in-indonesia)
## What is a business registration number?
The business registration number, commonly known as the Nomor Induk Berusaha (NIB), represents a significant stride towards streamlining the administrative procedures for businesses. This regulation was part of a broader government initiative to simplify the entrepreneurial landscape in Indonesia to bypass the cumbersome and time-intensive process of acquiring multiple permits.

### Business registration legal framework
The legal framework for business registration in Indonesia is governed by Government Regulation Number 24 of 2018, which details the procedures under the Integrated Electronic Business Licensing Services, or Online Single Submission (OSS).
According to Article 25, paragraph 1 of this regulation, the NIB serves not only as a business identity but also as a comprehensive permit that replaces all previous business licensing requirements.
The NIB is a mandatory requirement for all companies operating in Indonesia and serves multiple functions:
  * It provides **legal proof** that a company is recognized by the government and protected under Indonesian law.
  * A business registration number is essential for a company to apply for company tax⟨52⟩, file returns, and **perform other business operations legally**. Without this number, a company's operations are considered unlawful, and it faces risks such as being frozen or liquidated⟨49⟩ by the authorities.
  * The NIB also functions as the Importer Identification Number (API), which **facilitates customs processes and enhances market access.**


Businesses lacking a valid NIB are subject to stringent penalties⟨61⟩, including potential shutdowns by government authorities.
## Types of business entities
Investors must carefully evaluate their specific requirements before deciding on the type of corporate structure to establish⟨41⟩ in the country. Newcomers should engage a trusted local advisor to help navigate the regulatory environment more effectively.
Here's a table outlining the pros and cons of three different business structures in Indonesia:
  * Foreign Investment Company (PT PMA);
  * Representative Office (RO); and,
  * Local Companies (Individually Incorporated Companies).

Business Structure |  Pros |  Cons  
---|---|---  
Foreign Investment Company (PT PMA) | 
  * Allows 100% foreign ownership.
  * Can engage in full operational activities, including sales.
  * Eligible for various tax incentives.
  * Can own property in Indonesia.

| 
  * Requires a higher minimum capital investment.
  * More complex setup and reporting requirements.
  * Subject to restrictions in certain sectors as per the Positive Investment List.⟨18⟩

  
Representative Office (RO) | 
  * Easier and faster to establish compared to PT PMA.
  * No capital investment is required.
  * Suitable for market research and understanding local markets.

| 
  * Cannot engage in direct sales or revenue-generating activities.
  * Limited to non-commercial activities only.
  * Must rely on the parent company for funding.

  
Local Companies (Individually Incorporated Companies) | 
  * Allows Indonesian citizens to establish with relatively low capital.
  * Less stringent regulatory requirements.
  * Benefits from local small business incentives.

| 
  * Limited to Indonesian citizens only.
  * Restricted to micro or small enterprise categories.
  * Cannot raise funds through foreign direct investment.
  * Business scale and scope are limited.

## Benefits of a business registration number
### Legal protections
The primary benefit of acquiring a NIB is the legal recognition it offers. Companies holding an NIB are officially recognized by the Indonesian government, ensuring protection under the nation’s laws and regulations. This registration not only safeguards the business legally but also significantly mitigates the risk of governmental shutdowns or penalties.
Did You Know
Without an NIB, businesses are susceptible to being frozen or dissolved during inspections, as they are not legally acknowledged as legitimate entities.
Moreover, public reporting of unlicensed businesses can lead to severe legal consequences, emphasizing the NIB's role in establishing a company's legal foundation in Indonesia.
### Market credibility and business operations
A registered business gains immediate credibility with consumers, suppliers, and potential investors. The NIB serves as proof that a business is a recognized entity within the state, enhancing its reputation and trustworthiness in the marketplace.
This is particularly vital in Indonesia, where business tenders and large transactions often require verifiable credibility. Additionally, the NIB allows companies to engage in a variety of essential business activities that are otherwise restricted, including:
  * Importing goods⟨93⟩, as the NIB doubles as an Import Identification Number.
  * Applying for work visas ⟨63⟩for foreign employees is crucial for businesses looking to bring in international talent.
  * Participating in business tenders across Indonesia, thereby expanding market opportunities.
  * Registering for health and manpower social security programs⟨66⟩, which are mandatory for legitimate operations.


## Step-by-step guide to obtaining a business registration number
This detailed guide outlines the process, identifies the required documents, and highlights common pitfalls to avoid, along with providing expected timeframes for each step.
### Required documents
To apply for an NIB, companies must gather the following documents:
  * **Business Establishment Deed:** This is your company’s foundational legal document.
  * **Approval from the Ministry of Law and Human Rights** : This confirms your company's name and legal status.
  * **Tax Identification Number (NPWP):** Essential for all tax purposes.


### Step-by-step process
The application process for obtaining an NIB involves several key steps, each with its own timeframe:
Nr. |  Step |  Duration |  Process Description  
---|---|---|---  
1 |  Company name approval  |  1 working day |  Register your company’s name with the Ministry of Law and Human Rights to ensure it is unique and not already in use.  
2 |  Preparation of the Articles of Association |  About 4 working days |  Draft and notarize your company’s Articles of Association. This document outlines the structure and purpose of your business.  
3 |  Obtain a Tax Identification Number (NPWP) |  Approximately 3 working days |  Apply for an NPWP at the local tax office. This number is crucial for all tax-related activities.  
4 |  Submission of the Deed of Establishment and obtaining the Decree from the Ministry of Law and Human Rights |  About 2 working days |  This legal document is approved by the Ministry of Law and Human Rights, officially establishing your company.  
5 |  Create your OSS account and submit the application to the system  |  Up to 2 working days |  This approval from the Indonesian Investment Coordinating Board is crucial for foreign investors and involves a review of your business activities and investment plan.  
### Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
  * **Delays in documentation** : Ensure all documents are completed and accurately filled out before submission to avoid delays.
  * **Compliance with local laws** : Stay informed about changes in Indonesian business law⟨45⟩ to ensure compliance and prevent legal issues.
  * **Underestimating timeframes** : Be prepared for potential delays in government processes; start early and allow for more time than the minimum estimates.


### Timeframes and expectations
The entire process to obtain an NIB can **take between 4 to 6 weeks** , which includes the process of drafting the AoA, and deed of establishment, until the obtainment of the Decree Letter from the Ministry of Law and Rights, along with the tax ID. It’s essential to closely monitor each stage and maintain constant communication with the relevant authorities to ensure a smooth registration process.
## What to do once you have your Business Registration Number
### Immediate actions post-registration
  * **Open a corporate bank account** : Opening a bank account⟨43⟩ for your company is essential for any financial transactions. It is noteworthy that you can open an Indonesian company bank⟨73⟩ account without the need to be physically present in the country, which simplifies the process for foreign investors.
  * **Acquire property and assets** : With a Business Registration Number, your company can rent or purchase property and other assets in Indonesia. It's important to select a location for your physical office based on your business needs and restrictions.
  * **Initiate operational setups** : Begin the practical aspects of setting up your business operations. This includes recruiting staff⟨46⟩, preparing your office space, and any other logistical arrangements necessary for operational readiness. Efficient planning at this stage can significantly save time and resources.
  * **Secure work and residence permits for foreign employees** : If your business plan includes hiring foreign nationals, you'll need to navigate the process of obtaining work and residence permits for these employees. Understanding and complying with Indonesian regulations regarding foreign workers is crucial.


### Ongoing compliance and annual requirements
Maintaining compliance with Indonesian business regulations is crucial for the continued legality and success of your enterprise. Here are the key ongoing compliance requirements and annual obligations:
  * Regularly review and adhere to local business laws and regulations, which may change over time. This includes complying with labor laws⟨45⟩, safety standards, and industry-specific guidelines.
  * Ensure timely and accurate tax filings. The Business Registration Number allows your company to be recognized for tax purposes, and it's essential to maintain up-to-date records and submit tax returns as required.
  * Depending on your business structure and the nature of your business, you may need to file annual reports and renew certain permits. These filings typically include financial statements and reports on company activities throughout the year.
  * Larger businesses or those in certain regulated industries⟨18⟩ may be required to undergo annual audits. Prepare for these by keeping detailed financial records and having accounting processes in place that meet Indonesian accounting standards⟨60⟩.
  * Some business activities require licenses that need regular renewal. Keep track of renewal dates for all necessary licenses and permits to avoid legal complications.


## Regional Insights
### Business Registration in Jakarta vs. Other Regions
Jakarta, as the economic heart of Indonesia, offers a dynamic business environment with a well-established infrastructure and a vast network of business services. Here, the processes and systems for business registration are typically streamlined and more efficient, reflecting the city's role in attracting international investments.

However, this also means that the cost of doing business— from renting office space to salary expectations—is generally higher in Jakarta compared to other regions.
In other regions of Indonesia⟨9⟩, such as East Java or Bali, the process of business registration might involve more localized procedures. These areas may not have the same level of infrastructure or government efficiency as Jakarta, potentially leading to longer processing times. However, these regions often offer lower operational costs and may have specific local incentives designed to attract businesses to less saturated markets.
#### Local business practices
Understanding and adapting to the local business culture is crucial for success in Indonesia. Here are a few key cultural practices to be aware of:
  * Indonesian business culture places a significant **emphasis on building personal relationships**. Face-to-face meetings are preferred, and taking the time to develop mutual trust and respect is crucial before moving forward with business transactions.
  * **Indonesians tend to communicate in a non-confrontational, indirect manner**. It's important to pay attention to non-verbal cues and be sensitive to the tone of voice and body language. **Patience and politeness are highly valued**.
  * When meeting Indonesian business counterparts, it is customary **to exchange business cards upon introduction**. Offer and receive the card with both hands as a sign of respect. It is also important to address individuals with appropriate titles unless instructed otherwise.
  * **Negotiations** in Indonesia **may take longer** than in more direct cultures. The process is often seen as a way to build a relationship, not just to finalize a transaction. Patience during negotiations is considered a virtue and is expected from both parties.
  * **Each region in Indonesia might have its own additional regulations and compliance requirements**. For instance, some areas have stricter rules about foreign ownership and employment, while others might offer tax incentives for certain types of businesses.

# Minimum Wage in Indonesia
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/human-resources-and-payroll/minimum-wage)
The local government determines the minimum wage based on economic and employment conditions. These comprise of the following variables:
  

Contributing Advisor
  * Purchasing power parity;
  * Manpower absorption levels; and
  * Median wage variables (the margin between 50 percent of the highest wages and 50 percent from the lowest 50 percent of the lowest wages from employees in the same position).


These variables are assessed based on existing data from the last three years. The wage council will also take into account economic growth or provision rate inflation, as well as the per capita consumption of working household members.
If the provincial, regional, or city minimum wage is currently higher than the sectoral minimum wage, then businesses will have to apply the provincial, regional, or city minimum wage.
## Who does the minimum wage apply to?
The minimum wage applies to all workers with less than one year of working in the company. After one year, the employee is eligible to be paid in accordance with the scale of wages in the particular company, if they wish to do so.
Did You Know
Businesses are no longer permitted to postpone the payment of the minimum wage for their employees like before unless they are classified as micro or small businesses.

## Minimum wage increase
Minimum wages across the country will increase by a maximum of 10 percent for 2023. Minimum wage is calculated using the below formula: 
**UM (t+1) = UM (t) + (Adjustment of UM value x UM (t))**
Where,
  * UM (t+1) = the minimum wage to be determined; and
  * UM (t) = the current minimum wage.


Further,
The following equation is used to find the figure of the adjustment of the UM value from the above formula.
Adjustment of UM value = Inflation + (EG x α)
  * Inflation = refers to provincial inflation from September last year to September this year.
  * EG = economic growth; and
  * α = an index that describes the contribution of labor to economic growth, valued at a range of between 0.10 and 0.30.


## Working hours
Normal working hours in Indonesia are 40 hours per week, which can be divided into eight hours per day for five working days or seven hours per day for six working days.
Working hours of less than 40 hours per week would be recognized if the company has the following characteristics:
  * Undertake work that can be completed in less than 35 hours per week;
  * Can implement flexible working hours; and
  * Undertake work that can be completed outside a particular location.


## Overtime
The overtime working hours are four hours per day and 18 hours per week, which does not apply to public holidays.

Collective labor agreements, company regulations, or employment agreements should specifically state which roles are entitled to overtime pay. If this is not expressed, then the employee will automatically be entitled to receive this payment.
The overtime payment is based on the employee’s monthly wage. Every hour, the calculation is applied, which is 1/173 times the monthly wage. The calculation of the overtime payment is also categorized by the day of the overtime: working days, weekends, or public holidays. The regulation does include provisions on employees that are exempt from overtime pay eligibility. These are:
  * Employees that hold certain positions with responsibilities as thinkers, controllers, planners, executors, etc.;
  * Workers whose working hours cannot be capped, such as those in managerial roles; and
  * Workers that are paid high salaries.


## Hourly wages for part-time workers
Part-time workers are now eligible for hourly wages — a first for Indonesia. Hourly wages are reserved for part-time workers only.
The formula for determining the hourly wage is as follows:
**Hourly wage = Monthly wage/126**
To calculate the daily wage:
Six working days/week
**Daily wage = Monthly wage/25**
Five working days/week
**Daily wage = Monthly wage/21**
The employer and employee are allowed to set their agreement, but the final salary should not be lower than the calculation using the aforementioned formulas. The agreed-upon wage structure must also be reported to the Ministry of Manpower.
The wage must be paid in Rupiah or the Rupiah equivalent of a foreign currency. Any non-cash portion in payment may not exceed 25 percent of total wages.
## Minimum wages for micro and small businesses
Micro and small enterprises are exempted from paying the provincial, regional, or city-level minimum wage. However, their workers should be paid at least 50 percent of the average public consumption or 25 percent above the poverty line at the provincial level.
### Deductions
Any deductions made from an employee’s salary must only be for one of the following:
  * The payment of fines;
  * Payment of damages caused by the employee (must not exceed 50 percent of the employee’s monthly salary);
  * Salaries are paid upfront;
  * Rent for property rented by the employer for the employee;
  * Employee debts or installments to the employer; or
  * Salary overpayments.


### Sanctions
Employers who fail to pay their employees within the specified deadline can face a fine of five percent of the employees’ wage, every day, starting from the fourth day after the deadline. If the wage is unpaid after the eighth day, the employer will be imposed an additional one percent of the employees’ wage, per day.
Further, if an employer does not prepare a wage structure and wage scale for the employee, they can face the following sanctions:
  * Written warning letters;
  * Restriction on business activities;
  * Temporary suspension of business; and/or
  * Revocation of business license.

# Comprehensive Guide to Halal Certification in Indonesia 
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/company-establishment/halal-certification-guide)
## What is a Halal Certification?
Halal certification is a formal acknowledgement that a product meets the stringent dietary standards as prescribed by Islamic law. This certification is crucial for products that require assurance for consumption and use by Muslim consumers, ensuring the ingredients, production process, and handling meet the required halal standards.
  

Contributing Advisor
### Importance and benefits of Halal Certification
Halal certification provides a multitude of benefits, influencing not only market dynamics⟨17⟩ but also consumer trust and business credibility. In Indonesia, where the majority of the population adheres to Islam, the certification is not only a label but also a significant economic and social influencer.
#### For consumers
  * Halal certification **offers consumers assurance** that the products they purchase are in strict compliance with Islamic dietary laws, undergoing rigorous checks and balances during production.
  * Knowing a product is certified halal **alleviates concerns for Muslim consumers** about inadvertently consuming non-halal items, thus respecting their religious and personal dietary preferences.
  * For many practicing Muslims, consuming halal products is not just a personal preference but a spiritual obligation. Halal certification **helps them fulfill this aspect of their faith** more seamlessly.


#### For businesses
  * Halal certification opens doors to both national and international markets, particularly in regions with significant Muslim populations. For Indonesian businesses⟨40⟩, this means an opportunity to **expand beyond local markets** and tap into global halal demand.
  * Businesses that obtain halal certification can **boost their brand's trustworthiness** and **appeal to a broader demographic**. This is particularly crucial in competitive industries where establishing consumer trust can significantly impact business success.
  * Possessing a halal certificate **provides a competitive edge** , positioning a product as preferable over others in a crowded market, and can be a key differentiator for brands.


### Principles of Halal Certification
Halal certification is governed by a set of core principles that ensure products are permissible under Islamic law.

These principles are not merely about abstaining from haram (forbidden) ingredients but encompassing the entire lifecycle of a product—from sourcing materials to processing and packaging. The primary goal is to maintain a strict separation from anything considered impure or harmful according to Islamic teachings.
To begin with, halal certification requires that products must not contain, or come into contact with, any pork products, alcohol, or any other ingredients derived from animals not slaughtered according to Islamic rites. This comprehensive scrutiny extends to all facets of production, ensuring that there is no cross-contamination even at the level of processing equipment and facilities.
#### Ingredients and processes considered in Halal Certification
##### Ingredient compliance
The first layer of halal certification involves the thorough examination of all ingredients used in a product. Ingredients must be free from any haram substances, and this includes additives, enzymes, and flavorings which must all be vetted for their source and method of production.
##### Slaughtering practices
For meat products, the slaughtering process is a critical aspect of halal certification. The animals must be healthy at the time of slaughter and must be killed in a manner that includes a swift incision to the throat while reciting a prayer. The process is designed to ensure minimal suffering to the animal and is strictly monitored by certifying bodies.
##### Production processes
Every aspect of the production process is scrutinized under halal certification standards. This includes examining how the food is prepared, processed, and handled. Facilities must be free of any non-halal items and must not use the same production lines or equipment for halal and non-halal products unless thorough sanitization processes are followed.
##### Packaging and labeling
Ensuring that packaging materials are also free from haram substances is crucial. Furthermore, clear labeling is required to help consumers easily identify halal-certified products. This transparency is essential not only for compliance but also for consumer trust.
##### Cross-contamination measures
Companies must implement stringent measures to prevent cross-contamination between halal and non-halal products. This can involve dedicated production lines or comprehensive cleaning protocols to ensure that halal products maintain their integrity throughout the manufacturing process.
The comprehensive nature of these standards is what makes halal certification a rigorous and respected system globally. For companies in Indonesia, adhering to these standards is not just about accessing a lucrative market but also about respecting and upholding the dietary laws that govern a significant portion of the population.

## Legal and regulatory framework
### Governing bodies
The primary authority responsible for overseeing the Halal certification process is the Halal Product Assurance Agency (LPPOM MUI). LPPOM MUI ensures that all products and services meet the strict halal standards required by Indonesian law. Once a business⟨39⟩ applies for certification, the LPPOM MUI delegates the inspection and testing of the products or services to a designated Halal Inspection Agency. This structure ensures that the certification process is thorough and standardized, maintaining high compliance with religious dietary laws.
### Legal Requirements
The legal framework for Halal certification in Indonesia is outlined in Government Regulation 39 of 2021 (GR 39/2021⟨94⟩). According to this regulation, all products that are imported, distributed, or sold in Indonesia must be Halal certified, unless they are non-halal products (non-halal products shall be accompanied by the information that they are non-halal). This applies broadly across many sectors⟨17⟩, including food, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and tourism, reflecting Indonesia's status as the world's largest Halal market. The regulation highlights Indonesia’s commitment to ensuring that products comply with Islamic laws, catering to its majority Muslim population.
Under GR 39/2021, the process for obtaining Halal certification requires businesses to use only halal-approved materials and adhere to halal production processes. This includes specific requirements for storage, packaging, display, and sale to prevent any possibility of contamination with non-halal substances.
### Penalties for non-compliance
To reinforce the importance of halal certification, GR 39/2021 specifies strict penalties for non-compliance. Businesses that fail to secure the necessary Halal certification for products that require it can face **significant fines** and **restrictions on their operations**. These penalties are intended to ensure adherence to halal standards and to protect consumers who rely on the halal designation to make informed choices in accordance with their religious and personal values.
Moreover, GR 39/2021 not only updates the existing regulations by providing clearer guidelines for compliance but also revokes the previous Government Regulation 31/2019 on Halal certification.
## Which products and services must be Halal certified?
According to GR 39/2021, the following goods and services⟨53⟩ must be Halal-certified:
### Goods
  * Food and beverages;
  * Pharmaceuticals;
  * Cosmetics;
  * Chemical products;
  * Genetically modified products;
  * Biological products; and
  * Other goods people use or utilize.


### Services
  * Processing;
  * Storage;
  * Packaging;
  * Distribution;
  * Animal slaughter;
  * Sales; and,
  * Serving.


## Halal certification process
### Initial assessment and application
  * Begin the journey to Halal certification by implementing the Halal Assurance System (HAS) according to HAS 23000 standards.
  * Ensure business processes align with HAS 23000, structured around key themes for maintaining halal integrity throughout production.
  * Access resources such as thematic HAS 23000 books (available in print and electronic formats) and participate in HAS training offered by qualified institutions.
  * Start the formal application process by applying for the Registration Receipt (STTD) to the Halal Product Assurance Agency (BPJPH).
  * Retrieve necessary information and documents for the STTD application from the official BPJPH website.
  * Select LPPOM MUI, for conducting product inspections.
  * Register for product inspection through the CEROL online system, which involves entering detailed facility and product information and uploading required documents.


### Documentation and record-keeping
Effective documentation and record-keeping are pivotal in the halal certification process. Required documentation includes:
  * Previous Halal Decree for existing product groups during development or renewal.
  * HAS/SJPH Manual required for new, developing with HAS B status, or renewing registrations.
  * Most recent HAS Status/Certificate for ongoing development or renewal.
  * Production process flow chart for each type of halal-certified product.
  * A statement confirming exclusive use of production facilities for halal products unless non-halal production areas have undergone stringent cleaning protocols.
  * Addresses of all production-related facilities, including details for toll manufacturers and storage sites; additional supplier details required for non-halal certified raw materials in gelatin production.
  * Documentation demonstrating the dissemination of halal policies.
  * Credentials showing the expertise of the halal management team, including certificates and training records; additional proof needed for training at newly developed facilities.
  * Proof of internal HAS audit completion.
  * Official company licenses, including Business Identification Number⟨43⟩ and various business permits relevant to operational location.
  * Certifications or proofs of adherence to quality or safety systems like HACCP, GMP, or FSSC 22000.
  * BPJPH-issued Registration Receipt (STTD) for the certification process.


There is several additional information for abattoirs/slaughterhouses need to provide such as:
  * Name of slaughtermen involved.
  * Slaughtering method: manual or mechanical.
  * Stunning method: none, mechanical, or electrical.


### Facility inspection and compliance audit
Once the initial documentation is reviewed and approved, the next step involves a thorough facility inspection and compliance audit⟨61⟩ conducted by LPPOM MUI. This audit assesses all aspects of the production process to ensure they meet halal standards. Inspections cover the cleanliness of the facility, the integrity of the production process, and the compliance of storage and packaging practices with halal requirements.
### Product testing and analysis
The product testing and analysis phase involves detailed laboratory testing of product samples to ensure they adhere to the strict guidelines set forth by Islamic law. It is during this stage that any potential contamination or non-compliance issues are most likely to be identified.
### Certification decision and issuance of Halal Certificate
Following successful inspections and testing, the results are reviewed by the Majelis Ulama Indonesia (MUI) through its Fatwa Commission. The MUI determines the halal status based on the audit outcomes and issues the MUI Halal Decree if the products meet all the necessary criteria. Upon approval, the Halal certificate is issued, signifying that the company’s products are compliant with Islamic dietary laws.
The issuance of a Halal certificate is a significant achievement for any business looking to cater to the Muslim market, both in Indonesia and globally. Maintaining this certification requires ongoing adherence to halal standards, regular inspections, and renewal processes to ensure continuous compliance.
### Maintaining and renewing Halal Certification
#### Ongoing compliance requirements
Businesses⟨39⟩ must ensure that all aspects of their production—from ingredient sourcing to the manufacturing processes—consistently adhere to halal standards. This requires diligent monitoring of supply chains⟨21⟩ to guarantee that no non-halal materials enter the production environment.
Companies must keep their vigilance of any updates in halal regulations to ensure ongoing compliance, as the standards can evolve based on new dietary laws or technological advancements in food production.
#### Regular inspection and surveillance
To uphold the integrity of halal certification, inspections are needed to verify that businesses maintain the required halal standards in their operations. The frequency of these inspections can vary depending on the type of product or service, the size of the company⟨41⟩, and the previous compliance history of the business.
#### Renewal process
The validity period of halal certificates has been significantly revised under the new regulations:
Under GR 39/2021:
  * Halal certificates issued by BPJPH (Indonesia Halal Product Assurance Organizing Body) were valid for 4 years
  * Certificate renewal will require an application to be submitted at least 3 months before expiration


Under GR 42/2024:
  * Halal certificates now have permanent validity, eliminating the need for periodic renewal
  * This permanent status remains valid as long as: 
    * No changes are made to the material composition
    * No alterations occur in the halal product process (PPH)


However, businesses must update their halal certification if they:
  * Modify material composition;
  * Change their halal product process; and/or,
  * Develop new products In such cases, they must submit a new application to BPJPH along with documentation supporting these changes.


### The Halal certification compliance period
The government has taken into consideration the time businesses need to prepare their operations to be Halal compliant. Therefore, the government has set stages for Halal certification based on product type.
Under the original Government Regulation (GR) 39/2021, Indonesia mandated universal halal certification for all food and beverage products, ingredients, and slaughter-related services, with a single deadline of October 17, 2024, regardless of business size. However, this has been superseded by GR 42/2024, which introduces a more nuanced timeline structure.
Business Scales/ Categories |  Deadline  
---|---  
Medium and Large Enterprises |  17 October 2024  
Micro and Small Enterprises |  17 October 2026  
Foreign Products/ Services |  To be determined by the Minister of Religious Affairs before 17 October 2026, depending on the finalization of mutual recognition agreements for halal certification  
For non-food and beverage products subject to halal certification, the deadlines remain as set in GR 39/2021:
Business Scales/ Categories |  Halal Certification Period  
---|---  
Health supplements and traditional medicine |  17 October 2021 – 17 October 2026  
Over-the-counter medicine |  17 October 2021 – 17 October 2029  
Drugs excluding psychotropics |  17 October 2021 – 17 October 2034  
Cosmetics, generally modified products, chemical products |  17 October 2021 – 17 October 2026  
Clothing, headgear |  17 October 2021 – 17 October 2026  
Household health supplies, office supplies, household appliances |  17 October 2021 – 17 October 2026  
Medical devices classified as risk class A |  17 October 2021 – 17 October 2026  
Medical devices classified as risk class B |  17 October 2021 – 17 October 2029  
Medical devices classified as risk class C |  17 October 2021 – 17 October 2034  
### Foreign Halal Certification
New foreign product certification requirements under GR 42/2024, where the foreign products requiring Indonesian halal certification must apply through either:
  * An Indonesia-based importer
  * An authorized representative located in Indonesia


Certification is required when:
  * The product's country of origin lacks a halal certification institution
  * The foreign halal institution has a mutual recognition agreement but cannot certify the specific product
  * There is no cooperation or mutual recognition agreement between the foreign halal institution and BPJPH
  * The business voluntarily seeks Indonesian certification


Products may skip full certification if:
  * They already hold halal certification from their country of origin
  * The certifying institution has a mutual recognition agreement with BPJPH


Registration requirements:
  * All foreign halal-certified products must still be registered before distribution in Indonesia
  * The registration process remains as outlined in GR 39/2021
  * Registration validity matches the foreign halal certificate's duration
  * Key change: Registration renewal applications must be submitted 60 days before expiration (reduced from the previous 90-day requirement under GR 39/2021)


## New business obligations under GR 42/2024
Government Regulation 42/2024 expands upon the existing requirements of GR 39/2021, introducing new obligations for businesses holding halal certification. Under the revised regulation, certified businesses must:
  * Affixing a halal label to products that have been certified halal;
  * Maintaining the halal integrity of products that have received halal certification;
  * Separating locations, facilities, and tools used for slaughter, processing, storage, packaging, distribution, sale, and presentation between halal and non-halal products;
  * Renewing the Halal Certificate if there is a change in ingredient composition and/or the PPH; and
  * Reporting any changes in material composition and/or PPH to BPJPH.


Non-compliance with these requirements may trigger administrative penalties, including:
  * Written warnings
  * Financial penalties
  * Halal certificate revocation
  * Mandatory product withdrawal from distribution


## Choosing the right Halal Certification partner
Selecting a Halal certification partner is a crucial decision for businesses aiming to ensure their products meet Halal standards, particularly in a market as significant as Indonesia, which boasts the largest Muslim population globally. When choosing a certification partner, it’s important to consider several key aspects:
  * Opt for a partner with deep expertise in Halal Certification, accumulated through years of experience and a deep understanding of the religious, cultural, and regulatory framework that influence Halal compliance.
  * Ensure that the partner is recognized by major Halal authorities both in Indonesia and internationally, as this broad acceptance is important for businesses looking to expand into global Muslim markets.
  * Look for transparency in their process and a strong ethical framework, which are essential for maintaining trust and credibility.
  * The partner should have a proven track record of keeping up with both local and international regulatory standards, ensuring that your products consistently meet the required guidelines.

# Types of Business in Indonesia
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/company-establishment/what-are-my-option-for-investment)
Investors should assess their specific needs carefully before deciding which corporate structure to operate from. Using a reliable local advisor is recommended for first-time investors in the country, as they find it easier to remain compliant with applicable regulations.
  

Contributing Advisor
There are two legal options for foreign investors looking to set up in the country:
  * A foreign investment company (PT PMA⟨93⟩) or
  * Representative office (RO).⟨94⟩


 Also Read⟨95⟩ Indonesia Issues New Regulation on Investment Activity Reports⟨95⟩
## Foreign investment company (PT PMA)
Establishing a foreign investment company or PT PMA, is the preferred structure for companies to establish a legal presence in the country. Foreign investors should have a minimum paid-up capital equivalent of 10 billion rupiah (US$696,000), an increase from the previous 2.5 billion rupiah (US$174,135), as the government aims to attract more high-value investments into the country.
Prior to setting up, applicants should study the new Positive Investment List (PIL)⟨96⟩ to see which business sectors are unavailable or restricted for foreign ownership. The general principle under the positive investment list is that a business sector is open to 100 percent foreign investment unless it is subjected to a specific type of limitation.
### Advantages of PT PMAs
When compared with a KPPA i.e. RO, there are several advantages of setting up a Foreign Investment Company (PTPMA) in Indonesia, such as: 
  * Special financial and non-financial incentives, particularly in pioneer industries;
  * Incentives for setting up in special economic zones (SEZs);
  * Foreign investors can own as little as one percent and as much as 100 percent of the company (depending on the industry);
  * Able to participate in government sponsored business tenders in the country;
  * Ease of processing for business licenses;
  * Ease of processing for work permits;
  * Lower tax and import duties;
  * Simple organization structure (requiring only one director, one commissioner, and two shareholders); and
  * Ability to sponsor foreign executives.


### What are the set-up requirements for a foreign investment company?
Investors looking to incorporate a PT PMA need to adhere to the following requirements:
  * A minimum paid up capital of 10 billion rupiah (US$696,000);
  * Appointment of two shareholders (these can be foreign individuals or corporations - the percentage of local involvement will depend on the foreign ownership limitation based on the PIL);
  * The appointment of at least one commissioner and a director (these can be held by foreign individuals); and
  * The director will be responsible for running the day-to-day activities of the company.


### Set up process for a PT PMA
Establishing a PT PMA will require that the following steps be fulfilled:
  * Reserve a company name with the Ministry of Law and Human Rights (which should not be similar to. the name of other companies or contain vulgar language). Further, the company name shall consist of 3 words and can be in English;
  * Determine the industrial business classification code (KBLI), based on the intended business activities;
  * Establish a legal entity with the company’s activities stated in the Deed of Establishment (this must be done with a local notary and the Deed of Establishment will have to be ratified by the Ministry of Law and Human Rights);
  * Obtain a taxpayer identification number from the local tax office and a domicile letter from the district government (businesses established in Jakarta do not require a domicile letter);
  * Obtain a tax registration certificate through the tax office where the business is domiciled;
  * Obtain a Business Identification Number (NIB) by applying through the Online Single Submission (OSS) system. The NIB applies as the company’s import identification number, customs ID, and registration certificate. Further, the NIB will also automatically register your company under the government’s health and social security scheme; and
  * Some companies may need to apply for additional business licenses (such as for mining and fintech). Business licenses will now be issued based on the assessment of the ‘business risk level’ determined by the scale of hazards a business can potentially create.


### What are the requirements to obtain a business license?
The requirements vary depending on the risk level of the business with those in the high-risk categories requiring more permits and licenses.
The first stage of the process is obtaining a business registration number (_Nomor Induk Berusaha_ – NIB) through the OSS system. To register for an NIB, businesses will need to provide the following information:
  * Taxpayer number (_Nomor Pokok Wajib Pajak_ – NPWP);
  * Business activity code according to the KBLI;
  * Business profile;
  * The capital structure of the business; and
  * The proposed location of the business.


Furthermore, the OSS system will be linked to all relevant ministries, such as the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Home Affairs, and the Ministry of Law and Human Rights.
### Risk-based business licensing for a PTMA
Business licenses are issued to PT PMAs in some sectors only once an assessment of their ‘business risk level’ has been conducted. Such assessments aim to determine the scale of hazards a business can potentially create.
The government undertakes the analysis for business activities in the following sectors:
  * Maritime affairs and fisheries;
  * Agriculture;
  * The environment and forestry;
  * Energy and mineral resources;
  * Nuclear energy;
  * Industry;
  * Trading;
  * Public works and housing;
  * Transport;
  * Health, medicine, and food;
  * Education and culture;
  * Tourism;
  * Religious affairs;
  * Post, telecommunications, broadcasting, electronic systems, and transactions;
  * Defense; and
  * Employment.


### What is involved in a Risk Assessment of a PT PMA?
The government conducts a risk analysis of each PT PMA application to determine the risk level, before deciding on issuing a business license. This comprises of:  

  * Identifying the relevant business activity;
  * Assessing the hazard level;
  * Assessing the potential occurrence of hazards;
  * Determining the risk level and business scale rating; and
  * Determining the type of business license.


Based on the aforementioned risk analysis, the business activities undertaken by the applicant company will be classified into one of the following types:
  * Low-risk businesses;
  * Medium-low risk businesses;
  * Medium-high risk businesses; and
  * High-risk businesses.


Important Tip
Based on this risk-based approach, the lower the business risk, the simpler the business licensing requirements will be.
#### Assessed Risk Levels for a PT PMA
##### Low-risk business activities
Low-risk business activities are only required to obtain an NIB to commence their operations. In addition to serving as the formal identity of the business, the NIB also serves as a company’s import identification number, as well as the number for registering with the national social insurance program.
##### Medium-low-risk business activities
Business activities in this category must obtain a NIB and Certificate of Standards before beginning operations. A Certificate of Standards is a statement of the fulfillment of certain business or product standards, which must be filled in through the OSS system.
The NIB allows the business to conduct activities from ‘preparation to the commercial stage’.
The preparation stage includes:
  * The procurement of tools or facilities;
  * Land acquisition;
  * Recruitment of manpower;
  * Feasibility studies;
  * Financing operations for the construction phase.


The commercial stage includes:
  * The production of goods/services;
  * Distribution of goods/services;
  * Marketing of goods/services; and
  * Other commercial activities.


##### Medium-high-risk business activities
For medium-high-risk business activities, companies will need to obtain an NIB and Certificate of Standards. However, the certificate will need to be verified by the central or regional government.
Important Tip
A company with a NIB and an ‘unverified’ Certificate of Standards is only permitted to conduct activities deemed in the preparation stage of operations.
Once the central or regional government is satisfied the business has fulfilled the specific business standards, they will issue the ‘verified’ certificate and the company can begin the commercial stage of operations.
##### High-risk business activities
High-risk business activities will require a NIB and a license to operate. The license will be issued once the business has fulfilled certain conditions and verifications set out by the central or regional government, which may include an environmental impact analysis.

The NIB, however, allows the business to conduct activities in the preparation stage of operations.
Depending on the products or services being provided, businesses may have to obtain other supporting licenses to conduct commercial activities regardless of what risk level their activities are classified as.
An illustration of the licensing requirements can be seen below:
Business line |  Business scale |  Risk level |  License |  Issuing Authority  
---|---|---|---|---  
Wholesale distribution |  Micro, small, medium, and large |  Low |  NIB |  Governor Regent or Mayor  
E-commerce operator |  Large and medium |  High |  NIB and license |  Ministry of Trade  
Freight forwarding |  All sizes |  Medium-high |  NIB and Certificate of Standards |  Governor

##  Representative Offices
Opening an RO is the fastest and simplest way of establishing a legal entity in the country. This setup is a temporary arrangement – ROs are not allowed to engage in any commercial activities, issue invoices, sign contracts, or earn any revenue.
Foreign investors can own 100 percent of this business entity and don’t have to contribute the same paid-up capital required by PT PMAs.
The business activities of ROs are limited to market research activities, obtaining information on potential clients, developing trade contacts, and gathering information on regulations and laws. 
We explore the four (4) types of ROs below:
  * Foreign representative office (FRO);
  * Representative office for a foreign trading company (TRO);
  * Representative office for a foreign construction company (BUJKA); and
  * Representative office for a foreign electricity company (JPTLA).


In addition, the law has simplified the process for establishing an RO in Indonesia.
The business activities of ROs are limited to – market research activities, obtaining information on potential clients, developing trade contacts, and gather information on regulations and laws. However, a BUJKA and JPTLA can generate revenue.
#### Foreign representative office (FRO)
A FRO is ideal for investors who are still exploring opportunities in Indonesia. The FRO is limited to non-commercial activities and there are no restrictions on the employment of foreign nationals. However, if an FRO does employ foreign workers, then it is also obligated to employ Indonesian citizens.
FROs are limited to:
  * Acting as a liaison, coordinator, or supervisor to the foreign parent company;
  * Preparing for the incorporation of a foreign investment company in Indonesia;
  * Not participating in the management of the parent company’s branch office or subsidiary in Indonesia; and
  * Not seeking revenues from Indonesia.


The FRO must be incorporated in an office building in the capital city of any province in Indonesia. Further, FROs are classified as low-risk business entities and thus only require a business identification number (NIB) and an FRO registration to begin operations.
#### Representative office for a foreign trading company (TRO)
A TRO acts as a selling, buying, or manufacturing agent for the foreign parent company and is prohibited from engaging in any trade or sales activities. To establish a TRO, an NIB, and a TRO Business License for the Trade Sector (_Surat Izin Usaha Perwakilan Perusahaan Perdagangan Asing Bidang Perdagangan Melalui Sistem Elektronik_ – “SIUP3A Bidang PMSE”) is required.
Each TRO must have a SIUP3A, and if the TRO wants to conduct imports, then must be done through a local company holding a business license or a foreign investment company holding a general import identification number.
Foreign e-commerce organizers must establish a TRO if they fulfill the following criteria:
  * Having more than 1,000 transactions with customers within a one-year period; and/or
  * Delivered over 1,000 packages for customers within a one-year period.


#### Representative office for a foreign construction company (BUJKA)
A BUJKA is an RO for foreign construction companies, and unlike the KPPA and KP3A entities, a BUJKA can undertake projects in Indonesia through a joint venture with a local construction company. the BUJKA entity is required to obtain an NIB and a business entity certificate (_Sertifikat Badan Usaha_) (SBU).
In addition to making a joint venture with a local construction firm, the BUJKA is also required to adhere to the following:
  * Fulfill all business licensing requirements;
  * Hire an Indonesian as head of the BUJKA representative office;
  * Utilizing sophisticated, efficient, and environmentally friendly technology;
  * Prioritize the use of local construction materials;
  * Employ more Indonesian workers than foreign workers at the expert level; and
  * Carry out the transfer of knowledge and technology to Indonesian workers.


The joint venture with the local construction firm must also fulfill the various technical criteria such as stating the rights, responsibilities, and obligations in a written agreement between the cooperating businesses.
Further, at least 50 percent of the cost value of any construction work undertaken by the joint venture must be done onshore, and at least 30 percent of the cost value of the project shall be borne by the BUJK entity.
#### Representative Office for Foreign Electricity Supporting Services (JPTLA)
A JPTLA is a representative office for businesses in the field of electricity supporting services. The JPTLA must obtain a NIB and a business entity certificate.
The JPTLA business licensing is granted to the following activities:
  * Construction of electricity installation;
  * Consultation for electricity installation; and
  * Maintenance of electricity installation.


The JPTLA can undertake high-cost electricity-supporting services with the following threshold:
  * Projects for the construction and installation of electricity infrastructure worth at least 100 billion rupiah (US$6.9 million); or
  * Projects for consultation in the field of electrical maintenance and installation worth at least 10 billion rupiah (US$696,000).


Further, the JPTLA representative office must appoint an Indonesian citizen in charge of the office and conduct technology and knowledge transfers to Indonesian workers. The JPTLA must prioritize the utilization of domestic products as well as the use of high-tech and environmentally friendly technology.
### General set-up requirements for ROs
Foreign investors looking to open an RO will need to fulfill the following requirements:
  * Register through the OSS online system;
  * The parent company’s Articles of Association legalized by a notary and the Indonesian Embassy of the parent company’s country of origin;
  * Letter of Appointment by the Indonesian Embassy located in the parent company’s country of origin;
  * Latest financial statements of the parent
  * Letter of intent legalized by a notary and the Indonesian Embassy located in the parent company’s country of origin;
  * Certificates demonstrating competency in the relevant industry or sub-sector;
  * Lease agreements;
  * Must be located in the capital of a province; and
  * A letter that states the RO will not engage in any commercial activities in Indonesia. 


## Individually incorporated companies
Individually owned companies are a new type of company category that can be incorporated by a single individual, who is at least 17 years of age. This category of company is for **Indonesian citizens only**. An individually owned company is only applicable to businesses categorized as micro or small enterprises. Businesses categorized as micro or small enterprises must fulfill the following capital or annual sales criteria.
Enterprise scale |  Capital |  Annual sales  
---|---|---  
Micro |  Up to 1 billion rupiah (US$69,000), excluding land and buildings |  Up to 2 billion rupiah (US$138,000)  
Small |  More than 1 billion rupiah (US$69,000) and up to 5 billion rupiah (US$345,000), excluding land and buildings |  More than 2 billion rupiah (US$138,000) and up to 15 billion rupiah (US$1 million)  
The incorporation of an individually owned company does not require a deed of establishment, rather the individual only needs to fill out an establishment statement through the Ministry of Law and Human Rights (MOLHR) website to obtain a registration certificate.
The statement must include the following information:
  * Name and domicile of the company;
  * Purpose and business activities of the company;
  * The amount of authorized, issued, and paid-up capital of the company;
  * Number of shares of the company;
  * Details of the founder of the company; and
  * Tax number of the founder of the company.


The individually owned company must change its legal status to a limited liability company if the number of shareholders is more than one person or the business no longer meets the criteria of a micro or small business. Another important aspect with regards to an individually owned company is that its liability is limited to the company’s capital.
### Minimum authorized capital required
The amount of paid-up capital is to be agreed upon by the founder(s) of the company. Once the founder(s) of the company have agreed on the amount of authorized capital, they must pay at least 25 percent of the total paid-up capital, and the proof of payment must be electronically submitted to the MOLHR within 60 days from the date of establishment.
### Obligation to file financial statements
Financial statements of individually owned companies must be submitted within six months of the end of their accounting period. Failure to submit financial statements will result in administrative sanctions ranging from a written warning to the suspension of business activities.
New protection and empowerment measures for small businesses
#### New protection and empowerment measures for small businesses
Indonesia’s Government Regulation 7 of 2021 (GR 7/2021) looks to provide greater protection and empowerment to Indonesia’s cooperatives, micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).
GR 7/2021 provides several facilities to encourage the growth of local MSMEs, such as mandating regional governments to provide at least 30 percent of the total land area for commercial areas for the promotion and development of MSMEs. In addition, the regulation has made it easier for MSMEs to obtain a business license, tax reductions, and reliefs, and are exempt from paying the provincial or the regency/city minimum wage.
### New MSME criteria
GR 7/2021 expands the criteria for an MSME. Previously, there were only two criteria: assets and revenue, and each had its own threshold for a company to be recognized as an MSME. Under GR 7/ 2021, MSMEs are categorized by their **business capital or annual sales**. The criteria exclude land and buildings.
#### Micro enterprises
Micro enterprises are businesses that have capital of no more than 1 billion rupiah (US$ 64,701) and annual sales of no more than 2 billion rupiah (US$129,403).
#### Small enterprises
Small enterprises are businesses that have capital of more than 1 billion rupiah (US$64,701) and annual sales of more than 2 billion rupiah (US$129,403) but less than 5 billion rupiah (US$323,508).
#### Medium enterprises
Medium enterprises are businesses with a capital of more than 5 billion rupiahs (US$323,508) and annual sales of more than 15 billion rupiahs (US$970,524) but less than 50 billion rupiahs (US$3.2 million).
### Ease of obtaining a business license
The Omnibus Law has implemented a centralized business licensing system. An MSME only needs to submit their national ID and a reference letter from their neighborhood association online to receive their business number.
The government will provide technical guidance, consultation, and training for all MSMEs in this process, hoping it will also increase their knowledge of national standards, such as for Halal certification, as well as other regulatory certificates.
### Ease of obtaining financing and incentives
MSMEs are able to use their business activity as a form of credit guarantee to obtain financing. Additionally, their tax administration process has been simplified.
Micro and small enterprises are eligible for incentives in the form of:
  * Regional tax reduction or relief;
  * Regional fee reduction or relief;
  * Subsidized loans;
  * Capital for MSMEs with innovative products that have market potential or are technology-based;
  * Financing of intellectual property rights;
  * Vocational training; and
  * Support for research and development.


The government can act as a guarantor for up to 80 percent of loans or financing provided by banks and other non-bank financial institutions to MSMEs.
Micro and small businesses must first fulfill the following criteria:
  * Must have just started business operations or are already operating;
  * Have a gross income of no more than 7.5 billion rupiah (US$485,262) per year;
  * The business activities are in: 
    * Agriculture;
    * Plantations;
    * Livestock;
    * Guesthouses/hostels;
    * Boarding houses;
    * Campgrounds;
    * Industry;
    * Transportation;
    * Restaurants; and
    * Stalls; and/or
  * Procure government goods or services electronically.


Medium-sized enterprises and large businesses can also receive the above-mentioned incentives if they develop export-oriented products, hire a local workforce, utilize micro or small enterprises to expand the business, and train and provide upskilling programs for micro or small businesses.
MSMEs are also exempt from paying the regional/city minimum wage rates.
### Priority location and development
GR 7/2021 mandates that ministries, state-owned enterprises, and regional-owned and private businesses must allocate 30 percent of their commercial areas, shopping centers, and public infrastructure for the promotion and development of MSMEs. Public infrastructure includes airports, toll road rest and service areas, railway stations, and terminals.
The rental fee for the area used for the promotion of the MSME should not exceed 30 percent of the commercial rental fee.
#### Government and state-owned entities to help facilitate demand
The central and regional government(s) must allocate 40 percent of their goods and services procurement budget for MSMEs.
### Cooperatives
There are new provisions to assist Indonesian cooperatives. GR 7/2021 reduces the requirement of primary cooperatives from 20 members to nine, and cooperatives can now be either single-purpose or multi-purpose cooperatives, aimed at attracting more members through this enterprise.
#### Shariah-based cooperatives
GR 7/2021 allows for the establishment of Shariah-based cooperatives, but the entity must contain the word ‘Shariah’ in the official name, and the Shariah principles must be stated in the cooperatives’ articles of association.
Obligation to file financial statements
#### Obligation to file financial statements
Financial statements of individually owned companies must be submitted within six months of the end of their accounting period. Failure to submit financial statements will result in administrative sanctions ranging from a written warning to the suspension of business activities.
Business licensing regime
#### Business licensing regime
Indonesia has now introduced a new business licensing regime whereby business licenses are issued based on the assessment of ‘business risk level’, determined by the scale of hazards a business can potentially create. The business activities undertaken by the applicant company will be classified into one of the following risk-level types:
  * Low-risk businesses;
  * Medium-low risk businesses;
  * Medium-high risk businesses; and
  * High-risk businesses.


Positive investment list
#### Positive investment list
Under the Law, Indonesia has liberalized over 245 business lines, including important sectors, such as transportation, energy, and telecommunications. The general principle under the positive investment list is that a business sector is open to 100 percent foreign investment unless it is subjected to a specific type of limitation. As such, the government has classified business fields into four categories.
  * Business fields that are fully open to foreign investment;
  * Priority sectors;
  * Business fields that stipulate specific requirements or limitations; and
  * Business fields are open to large enterprises, including foreign investors, but are subject to a compulsory partnership with cooperatives and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).


Labor laws
#### Labor laws
The Law has amended Indonesia’s labor laws. Changes include a formula for calculating the minimum wage, eliminating sectoral minimum wages, introducing provisions for hourly wages (for the first time), and income support for workers made redundant. Further, a new procedure for the disbursal of severance payments has been established.
Tax overhaul
#### Tax overhaul
The government has overhauled the existing tax structure to optimize tax revenue collection. The overhaul includes changes in the topline personal income tax rate. Individuals earning more than 5 billion rupiah (US$351, 000) per year in net income will now be subject to a 35 percent income tax, and individuals with an annual net income of up to 60 million rupiah per year (US$4,220) will be subject to a five percent tax rate, up from the previous threshold of 50 million rupiah (US$3,517).

This changed with the introduction of the PDP Law (Law No. 27 of 2022), which established a comprehensive legal structure to protect personal data across all sectors. Before this, provisions related to data protection were sporadically found in laws concerning electronic information and transactions, consumer protection, and other sectoral regulations in the sector of financial services, healthcare, technology and banking, which did not sufficiently cover all aspects of data privacy and security.
### Driving forces behind the enactment of the PDP Law
The push for Indonesia's dedicated Personal Data Protection (PDP) Law was driven by a mix of international trends towards stricter data privacy regulations and domestic challenges, including significant data breaches that exposed vulnerabilities in existing laws. The booming digital economy in Indonesia⟨93⟩, marked by an increase in personal data usage, required a robust legal framework to protect the privacy and build trust in digital services, as a result, supporting economic growth.
In shaping the PDP Law, Indonesian lawmakers adapted principles from global standards like the EU GDPR to address both international compliance needs and local challenges.
## Key definitions and concepts
This section explores the classification of personal data according to the PDP Law and outlines the specific protections afforded to different categories.
### Personal Data
The PDP Law defines "Personal Data" as any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual. This data can be identified or linked to an individual directly or indirectly, through combination with other information, whether processed through electronic systems or non-electronic means. This broad definition encompasses a wide range of data types and emphasizes the law's extensive reach in protecting personal information.
#### Categories of Personal Data
The PDP Law distinguishes between two main categories of personal data: general and specific (sensitive) personal data. Each category requires different levels of protection due to the varying degrees of privacy concerns they raise.
  * General Personal Data includes data typically found on identification documents and other general records. Examples include an individual's full name, gender, nationality, religion, and marital status. While important, the risk associated with the processing of general personal data is considered lower compared to sensitive data.
  * Specific Personal Data -regarded as more sensitive- this data includes: 
    * Health and medical information.
    * Biometric and genetic data.
    * Criminal records.
    * Children’s data.
    * Personal financial data.
    * Any other data deemed sensitive by law.


The handling of specific personal data is subject to stricter regulatory requirements due to the higher risk it poses to an individual's privacy and security. For instance, processing such data typically demands a thorough data protection impact assessment to evaluate and mitigate risks.
Moreover, organizations processing sensitive data may be required to appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO) to ensure compliance with the PDP Law, particularly when the processing activities involve large-scale operations or include data relating to criminal actions.
#### Data Protection principals
To ensure compliance, the PDP Law outlines several key principles that govern the processing of personal data:
  * **Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency** : Data must be handled legally, fairly, and in a transparent manner.
  * **Purpose Limitation** : Data should only be collected for explicit, legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes.
  * **Data Minimization** : Only data that is relevant and necessary for the purposes specified should be processed.
  * **Accuracy** : Personal data must be kept accurate and up-to-date.
  * **Integrity and Confidentiality** : Data must be processed in a way that ensures security, including protection against unauthorized or illegal processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage.


Through these provisions, the PDP Law aims to align Indonesia's data protection standards with international norms while addressing specific local privacy concerns, thereby enhancing the trust and safety of digital interactions within the country.
### Data subjects’ rights under the PDP Law
Indonesia's PDP Law establishes robust rights for data subjects, designed to empower individuals and ensure their personal information is handled responsibly and transparently. Here we provide a comprehensive list of these rights and illustrate how they apply in real-world scenarios.
#### Comprehensive List of Rights under the PDP Law
  * **Right to be Informed** : Data subjects have the right to know the identity of the data collector, the legal basis for processing their data, the purposes of data collection, and how their data is being used.
  * **Right of Access** : Individuals can access and receive copies of their personal data held by an entity⟨41⟩.
  * **Right to Rectification** : Data subjects can update or correct inaccuracies in their personal data to ensure the information remains accurate and up to date.
  * **Right to Erasure** : Individuals can request the deletion or disposal of their personal data when it is no longer necessary for the purposes it was collected for, or if they withdraw consent.
  * **Right to Restrict Processing** : This right allows individuals to limit how their personal data is used, particularly in cases where the accuracy of the data is contested, or the processing is unlawful.
  * **Right to Object to Processing** : Data subjects can object to data processing in certain circumstances, such as for direct marketing purposes or when processing is based on automated decision-making that affects them significantly.
  * **Right to Data Portability** : Individuals can request a copy of their personal data in a digital format and can transfer their data from one service provider to another.
  * **Right to Withdraw Consent** : At any time, data subjects can withdraw consent previously given for processing their personal data.
  * **Right to Non-Discrimination** : Data subjects can exercise their privacy rights without any form of discrimination or penalty.
  * **Right to File a Lawsuit and Receive Compensation** : If their data privacy rights are violated, individuals have the right to seek legal remedies and compensation.
  * **Right to Complain** : Data subjects can lodge complaints with the relevant data protection authority regarding the handling of their personal data.
  * **Right to object to automated decision-making, including profiling** : Data subjects are allowed to not be subject to a decision if such a decision is based solely on automated processing, including profiling.


#### Use cases
##### Case 1: Incorrect personal data
Ayman notices that his date of birth is incorrect on his online banking⟨73⟩ profile. He uses his **Right to Rectification** to request the bank update his information, ensuring his personal data remains accurate and relevant.
##### Case 2: Unwanted marketing emails
After signing up for a newsletter, Hardy starts receiving marketing emails he no longer wishes to receive. He exercises his **Right to Object to Processing** by opting out of future communications, addressing his right to control how his personal data is used.
##### Case 3: Data breach notification
Following a data breach at a retail company, customers are notified of the incident. Affected individual, like Kaylana, uses her **Right to be Informed** to understand the extent of the breach and her **Right to Complain** to the national data protection authority to seek accountability.
##### Case 4: Switching service providers
Danur decides to switch to a new fitness tracking service and wishes to transfer his historical health data. He utilizes his **Right to Data Portability** to move his data securely from the old provider to the new one without hindrance.

## Scope, reach, and other protocols of the PDP Law
The PDP Law⟨95⟩, Law No. 27 of 2022, is a comprehensive legal framework enacted to safeguard personal data within and beyond the borders of Indonesia. This global reach aligns Indonesia's data protection practices with international standards, notably the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It applies to every individual⟨59⟩ or company⟨39⟩, public agency and international organization that performs legal acts as regulated under the PDP Law:
  * Within the jurisdiction of the Republic of Indonesia; and
  * Outside the jurisdiction of the Republic of Indonesia, provided that such act has legal consequences:
  * Within the jurisdiction of the Republic of Indonesia; and/or
  * For Personal Data Subject of Indonesian citizens outside the jurisdiction of the Republic of Indonesia.


In this regard, the PDP Law has extra-territorial scope as it would also cover any personal data of any Indonesian outside the jurisdiction of the Republic of Indonesia.
### Lawful bases for processing Personal Data
For data processing to be lawful under the PDP Law, it must meet certain criteria such as:
  * Obtaining express consent from data subjects for specific purposes;
  * Fulfilling contractual obligations;
  * Complying with legal requirements;
  * Protecting vital interests of the data subject;
  * Serving public interests; or
  * Legitimate interest.


These bases ensure that personal data is handled in a manner that respects the privacy and integrity of the data subject.
#### Regulatory authorities
The Indonesian Data Protection Authority (Indonesian DPA) is set to play a pivotal role in the nation's data privacy landscape. The authority is tasked with several crucial functions:
  * **Policy formulation** : The Indonesian DPA will be responsible for creating and enforcing policies and strategies that safeguard personal data.
  * **Supervision and monitoring** : This involves regular oversight of how personal data protection laws are implemented across various sectors.
  * **Enforcement** : The DPA will have the authority to enforce laws and regulations concerning violations of personal data protection.
  * **Dispute resolution** : The authority will also facilitate alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to handle data protection disputes outside of court settings.


Currently, the Ministry of Communication and Informatics (MOCI) temporarily fulfills these responsibilities. MOCI ensures compliance with data protection regulations within the electronic information and transactions (EIT) sector by coordinating data transfer across borders, overseeing data breach notifications, supervising data protection implementations, and enforcing administrative sanctions for non-compliance.
Coordination with sector-specific authorities will be essential, particularly in areas like banking and capital markets⟨17⟩ where sensitive personal data is prevalent. These bodies include the Financial Services Authority (FSA), which since 2012 and 2013, has been overseeing data privacy in the capital markets and banking sectors respectively.
Additionally, in cases where data protection issues escalate to criminal offenses, law enforcement agencies may step in to address these violations, potentially leading to prosecutions that involve fines or imprisonment.
### Stakeholders
The PDP Law identifies several key parties involved in the processing of personal data, including:
  * **Personal Data Subject** : This is the individual to whom the personal data belongs and who benefits from the protections offered by the PDP Law.
  * **Personal Data Controller** : This role is filled by individuals or entities, including public agencies and international organizations, who determine the objectives and manage the processing of personal data, either alone or jointly.
  * **Personal Data Processor** : Similar to the controller, this includes individuals or entities, public agencies⟨74⟩, and international organizations⟨75⟩ that process personal data on behalf of the Personal Data Controller.
  * **Data Protection Officer (DPO)** : This individual is designated by the personal data controller and processor to oversee data protection strategies. The DPO may be an internal or external appointee to the organization.


#### Personal Data Controller (“Controller”) and Personal Data Processor (“Processor”)
The PDP Law outlines roles for (a) Personal Data Controller (“Controller”) and (b) Personal Data Processor (“Processor”). The table below outlines the distinct yet complementary roles of Controllers and Processors under the PDP Law, highlighting their respective duties in the management and safeguarding of personal data:

Notify about the transfer of personal data during corporate actions |  Yes |  -  
Execute orders from the supervisory body concerning the protection of personal data |  Yes |  -  
#### Data Protection Officer (DPO)
The PDP Law has formalized the requirement for certain organizations to appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO). This role is crucial for ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and acts as a focal point for data protection activities within the organization.
##### Key functions of the DPO
  * The DPO advises the organization on complying with PDP law requirements and best practices, including matters related to data protection impact assessments (DPIA).
  * The DPO is responsible for monitoring the organization's data protection policies and their alignment with the PDP Law.
  * They conduct training sessions and awareness programs for staff about data protection principles and practices.
  * The DPO serves as the liaison between the organization and regulatory authorities for matters relating to data processing.


##### When is a DPO required?
Organizations are required to appoint a DPO under the PDP Law **if they process personal data as part of their core activities** that require regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale, or **if they handle large volumes of sensitive personal data or data related to criminal convictions and offenses.**
##### Sanctions for Non-Compliance
Failing to appoint a DPO where required can lead to administrative sanctions under the PDP Law, which may include fines, written warnings, or even temporary suspension of data processing activities.

## Breach notification and remediation
### Protocols for breach detection, reporting, and notification
Under Indonesia's PDP Law, stringent protocols have been established to address data breaches. When a data breach occurs, both the data controller and processor are mandated to notify the affected data subjects and the Indonesian Data Protection Authority (DPA) within 72 hours. The notification must include the following details:
  * The nature of the breached data;
  * The circumstances of the breach;
  * The steps taken to mitigate its effects, which include:
  * Assessing the scope and impact of the breach;
  * Identifying the compromised data; and,
  * Taking steps to secure and recover the affected systems.
  * If the breach affects public services or has a significant public impact, a broader public announcement may also be required.


### Sanctions and enforcement
The PDP Law specifies a range of administrative and criminal sanctions for non-compliance. Administrative penalties may include written warnings, temporary suspension of data processing activities, forced deletion of personal data, and potentially hefty fines.
Did You Know
For more severe violations, criminal penalties are also outlined, including monetary fines ranging from IDR 4 billion (USD 246,484) to IDR 6 billion (USD 369,687), and imprisonment ranging from 4 to 6 years.
In addition, if the criminal actions are conducted by a corporation⟨40⟩, the maximum fine can be multiplied by up to 10 times, and profits derived from unlawful activities may be seized, and other corporate sanctions could be applied.
#### Corporate liability and consequences
Corporations found in violation of the PDP Law face significant repercussions. Beyond the direct penalties imposed on the entity, such as fines and operational restrictions, individuals within the organization, including directors or managers, may also be held accountable. This underscores the importance for businesses to ensure rigorous compliance with the law, maintain accurate records⟨60⟩ of data processing activities, and implement effective data protection measures.

## Cross-border data transfer
The PDP Law sets forth specific criteria for the cross-border transfer of personal data from Indonesia, ensuring that such transfers meet stringent data protection standards. These rules are designed to protect personal data when it moves outside of Indonesia's borders:
  * The data exporter must ensure that the recipient country offers a level of personal data protection that **is equivalent to or exceeds that provided under the PDP Law**.
  * In the absence of adequate protection in the recipient country, the transferor must ensure that **adequate and binding safeguards** , such as **standard contractual clauses** , **are in place**.
  * If neither of the above conditions is met, **the transferor must obtain explicit consent** from the data subjects for the transfer of their personal data.
  * Additionally, the EIT regulatory framework mandates that cross-border data transfers be reported both before and after the transfer, detailing the recipient, the date of transfer, and the purpose. This report is typically submitted annually.


### Ensuring compliance with cross-border data protection standards
To comply with these regulations, companies engaged in the transfer of personal data internationally must adhere to the following practices:
  * **Assessment** : Before initiating data transfers, companies must evaluate whether the recipient country's data protection standards are equivalent to those required by the PDP Law.
  * **Implementation** : If the recipient country does not meet the adequacy requirement, the company must implement legally binding safeguards to protect the data.
  * **Obtaining data subject consent** : Where neither adequacy nor safeguards are feasible, explicit consent must be obtained from the data subjects, ensuring they are fully informed of the risks associated with the data transfer.


These rules ensure that personal data originating from Indonesia is protected in accordance with high standards, even when processed abroad. They also mandate cooperation between Indonesian data controllers and international jurisdictions, highlighting the need for a global approach to data privacy.
Furthermore, the specific mechanisms for these transfers, the necessary steps for compliance, and the role of regulatory bodies in supervising these activities are expected to be elaborated in forthcoming government regulations. Until then, companies must navigate these requirements carefully, potentially consulting with the Directorate General for Informatics Application (DITJEN APTIKA) within the Ministry of Communication and Informatics for guidance on compliance and reporting obligations related to cross-border data transfers.
## What should companies do to comply with PDP Law?
All personal data controllers, processors, and other relevant entities are required to align their policies and operational procedures with the PDP Law by October 16, 2024. This two-year window, following the law's enactment, provides a necessary period for organizations to make the appropriate internal adjustments, ensuring that their data processing activities conform to the new legal framework.
As Indonesia advances its PDP Law, the government is actively developing and implementing regulations. During this transitional period, companies⟨39⟩ are advised to engage in self-assessment to determine their role as personal data controllers or processors. Based on this assessment, several preliminary steps should be taken:
  * **Gap analysis** : Organizations should conduct a comprehensive review of their current personal data protection practices against the requirements of the PDP Law, including internal data processing guidelines, data protection policies, and existing contracts with customers, vendors, or other third parties which includes the processing of personal data.
  * **Updating privacy notices** : Companies must revise or draft new privacy notices to ensure transparency about how personal data is handled, making them accessible to external stakeholders.
  * **Revamping data protection policies** : It is essential for companies to update or establish robust data protection policies and guidelines for internal stakeholders to ensure compliance.
  * **Appointing a Data Protection Officer (DPO)** : Companies should appoint a DPO, either an internal member or an external consultant, to oversee compliance with the PDP Law. Implementing a privacy management technology platform can also support compliance and enhance data protection measures.
  * **Data inventory, mapping, and classification** : Organizations should conduct thorough data inventories and mapping exercises to classify data based on sensitivity and applicability under the PDP Law, which facilitates more effective data management and protection strategies.
  * **Implementing privacy by design and default** : Companies should integrate privacy into the design stage of any system, service, or product that involves personal data, ensuring that privacy settings are configured at the maximum level of protection by default.
  * **Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs**): Organizations are required to conduct DPIAs for processing activities that pose high risks to the privacy rights of individuals to identify and mitigate risks before any data processing activities are undertaken.
  * **Managing risks in data processing** : Companies must develop strategies to minimize risks associated with the processing of personal data, including implementing secure data processing practices, ensuring data accuracy, and maintaining integrity throughout the data lifecycle.

Establishing a company typically requires moderate or greater amounts of investment capital than other entry modes and can require several months to complete all steps in the process before the company becomes operational. This is an expected risk of a fixed investment strategy, and for these reasons, it is important that investors first understand the business, financial, consumer, or local cultural landscapes in the country and the options that might best help realize the goals of the investment.
Foreign investors may create a legal presence in Indonesia in one of two ways: a Limited Liability Company (PT PMA) or a Representative Office. This is discussed in the choosing a corporate structure⟨93⟩ section.
Also, prior to deciding upon a company or investment structure, it is important to understand the Positive Investment List (PIL) to verify whether your intended business sector(s) are available and unrestricted for foreign ownership. The general principle under the positive investment list is that a business sector is open to 100 percent foreign investment unless subject to a specific type of limitation. The regulation presents one of the greatest liberalizations in foreign ownership limitations in Indonesia since the negative investment list was first introduced in the 1980s. The positive list and restricted sectors are explained in this section⟨94⟩.
## Choosing a corporate structure
Establishing a foreign investment company or PT PMA, is the preferred structure for companies looking to have a legal presence in the country. Foreign investors will need to have a minimum paid-up capital equivalent of 10 billion rupiahs (US$696,000) currently, which is higher than it was at 2.5 billion rupiahs (US$174,135) in previous years, as the government aims to attract more high-value investments into the country.
Alternatively, foreign companies may open a representative office in one of Indonesia's provincial capital cities. Representative offices in Indonesia are restricted and not permitted to conduct business directly with other companies or people. However, they can serve other important functions, such as supervising and coordinating business activities, and applying for and obtaining a work permit and a visa for the expatriate manager.
Another important and new amendment is the introduction of individually-owned companies for Indonesian citizens. It is a new type of company category that can be incorporated by a single individual.
Important Tip
Investors should assess their specific needs carefully before deciding which corporate structure to operate from. Using a reliable local advisor is recommended for first-time investors in the country, as they find it easier to remain compliant with applicable regulations.

## Company set up process
A **foreign-invested limited liability company** , or PT PMA, generally requires 2-4 months to set up and be operational.
  * Reserve a company name with the Ministry of Law and Human Rights (which should not be similar to the name of other companies or contain vulgar language), Further the company name shall consist of 3 words and can be in English; 
  * Determine the industrial business classification code (KBLI), based on the intended business activities;
  * Establish a legal entity with the company’s activities stated in the Deed of Establishment (this must be done with a local notary and the Deed of Establishment will have to be ratified by the Ministry of Law and Human Rights);
  * Obtain a taxpayer identification number from the local tax office and a domicile letter from the district government (businesses established in Jakarta do not require a domicile letter);
  * Obtain a tax registration certificate through the tax office where the business is domiciled;
  * Obtain a Business Identification Number (NIB) by applying through the Online Single Submission (OSS) system. The NIB applies as the company’s import identification number, customs ID, and registration certificate. Further, the NIB will also automatically register your company under the government’s health and social security scheme; and
  * Some companies may need to apply for additional business licenses (such as for mining and fintech). Business licenses will now be issued based on the assessment of the ‘business risk level’ determined by the scale of hazards a business can potentially create.


A **Representative Office** , on the other hand, is the fastest and simplest way of establishing a legal entity in the country. A Rep Office set up is a temporary arrangement; As mentioned, an RO is not permitted to engage in any commercial activities, issue invoices, sign contracts, or earn any revenue. Foreign investors, however, can own 100 percent of this business entity and don’t have to contribute the same paid-up capital required by PT PMAs.
## Requirements for setting up a business
Investors looking to incorporate a PT PMA need to adhere to the following requirements:
  * A minimum paid-up capital of 10 billion rupiah (US$696,000);
  * Appointment of two shareholders (these can be foreign individuals or corporations - the percentage of local involvement will depend on the foreign ownership limitation based on the PIL);
  * The appointment of at least one commissioner and a director (these can be held by foreign individuals); and
  * The director will be responsible for running the day-to-day activities of the company.


A Representative Office has simpler requirements, two of the main being: 
  * Can only be set up in the capital of any Indonesian province; and.
  * Must be located in an office building. 


The simplified procedure for setting up a PTPMA or an RO can be seen below and read about in more detail in our Types of Businesses guide:⟨39⟩

## Indonesia’s Positive Investment List for Foreign Investment
Further, prior to setting up we also recommend studying the new Positive Investment List (PIL) to see which business sectors are unavailable or restricted for foreign ownership. The general principle under the positive investment list is that a business sector is open to 100 percent foreign investment unless subject to a specific type of limitation. The regulation presents one of the greatest liberalizations in foreign ownership limitations in Indonesia since the negative investment list was first introduced in the 1980s.
The government has classified business fields into four categories:
  * Priority sectors;
  * Business fields that stipulate specific requirements or limitations;
  * Businesses fields open to large enterprises, including foreign investors, but are subject to a compulsory partnership with cooperatives and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs); and
  * Business fields that are fully open to foreign investment.


### Business fields that are fully open to foreign investment
The following business fields are open to 100 percent foreign investment.
  * Oil and gas construction;
  * Onshore upstream oil installation;
  * Onshore and offshore distribution pipelines;
  * Onshore and offshore oil and gas drilling service;
  * Oil and gas well maintenance service;
  * Electricity generation;
  * Construction of electricity installation;
  * Geothermal electricity generation;
  * Supermarkets (with areas less than 1,200 sqm);
  * Department store (with areas between 400 – 2,000 sqm);
  * Ports;
  * Airport and airport supporting services;
  * Maritime cargo handling;
  * Telecommunications;
  * E-commerce;
  * Pharmaceutical industry; and
  * Hospitals.


### Priority sectors – 245 business lines open for foreign investment
To classify as a priority sector, business enterprises must meet the following criteria:
  * Must be labor intensive;
  * Must be capital intensive;
  * Must be part of a national project/program;
  * Must be export-oriented;
  * Must involve a pioneer industry (renewables, oil refining, metals, etc.);
  * Must utilize advanced technologies; and
  * Must implement research and development and innovation activities.


245 business fields under this category can be found under Exhibit 1 of the positive investment list. Moreover, businesses in priority sectors are eligible for a range of fiscal and non-fiscal incentives.
Fiscal incentives include a 50 percent corporate income tax reduction for investments between 100 billion rupiahs (US$6.9 million) and 500 billion rupiahs (US$34.8 million) for five years and 100 CIT reduction for investments over 500 billion rupiahs (US$34.8 million) for a period between five and 20 years.
In addition, there are tax allowances available in the form of a reduction in the taxable income of 30 percent of the total investment for six years, a special withholding tax rate on dividends of 10 percent, and tax losses carried forward for up to 10 years.
Examples of non-fiscal incentives are the provision of supporting infrastructure, simplified business licensing procedures, and the guaranteed energy supply or raw materials. We explore a few examples of the prioritized business lines and their incentives below.

How can I close a business in Indonesia?
#### How can I close a business in Indonesia?
The company dissolution process in Indonesia can be voluntary or non-voluntary. Voluntary dissolution occurs when the owners or investors of the business choose to close the business, due to a variety of reasons from low cash flow to the mismanagement of business operations to excessive company liabilities.
According to the Article 142, paragraph 1 of the Company Law, liquidation of the company occurs if one of the following cases is met:
  * Based on a resolution of the GMS (General Meeting of Shareholders) – In other words, voluntary winding-up
  * Due to the expiry of the company, as prescribed in the articles of association.
  * Based on a court order (because of any non-compliance with the law)
  * Due to a revoked bankruptcy statement, etc.; or
  * Due to the revocation of the company’s business permit, so that the company is obliged to conduct liquidation according to prevailing regulations.


The procedure for winding up of a RO is a much simpler process compared to a limited liability company.

# Business Visas in Indonesia
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/human-resources-and-payroll/visa-and-employment-permits)
There are a variety of visas foreign visitors can apply for depending on their purpose of visit.
  

Contributing Advisor
## Visa on arrival, social visit visas, and multiple-entry visas
Visa on arrivals is still valid for 30 days but can no longer be extended.
The single-entry visa, or the social visit visa, is issued to foreign travelers entering Indonesia for short internship programs, volunteer programs, meeting family, sports activities, and social activities, among others. The length of this stay is 180 days with no extension possible. 
Foreigners applying for the multiple entry visa can be granted a 180-day stay in Indonesia, which can be extended for a total stay of no more than one year.
### Social visit visas
The government has added ‘pre-investment’ activities as one of the activities foreigners can undertake in Indonesia under a visit visa. This refers to foreigners looking to start a business in Indonesia, and undertaking feasibility studies, among others.
If the foreigner does not have a guarantor, then the guarantee letter can be replaced with proof of payment of an ‘immigration guarantee’ to the Directorate General of Immigration.
#### Guarantors of expatriates
There’s an exemption for the requirement of a foreign worker in Indonesia to have a guarantor. Depending on their visa, foreigners needed a guarantor who was responsible for their activities in the country and report any change to their civil or immigration status to the authorities. This requirement was not required for foreigners legally married to Indonesians, foreign investors, or citizens of countries that also waived the guarantee requirements for Indonesians.
Foreign investors, foreigners who make Indonesia a second home, and foreigners engaged in pre-investment activities can now make an official payment to the Directorate General of Immigration, which will act as their immigration guarantee.
The payment will cover the cost of repatriation, deportation, or other immigration costs. If the immigration guarantee is not used during the foreigner’s stay in Indonesia, the full amount will be paid back.
#### Second home visa
Indonesia has announced plans to issue second home visas, the first of its kind for the country, which will allow foreigners to stay for up to 10 years. Applicants must have a minimum of 2 billion rupiah (US$133,000) as proof of funds, a passport that is valid for a minimum of 36 months, and a curriculum vitae.
## Business Visas
This is a single-entry visa valid for 60 days upon arrival and can be extended up to four times. This type of visa is intended for businesspeople who are engaging in meetings in the country, attending conferences, or undertaking market research.
Did You Know
Business visas must be sponsored by a legal entity in Indonesia and the holders are not allowed to gain employment while in the country. 
### Multiple entry business visas
Multiple entry business visas allow foreign visitors to make repeated trips to Indonesia for one year. The visa, however, has a 60-day limit upon arrival, meaning that visitors will have to leave the country before it expires before entering Indonesia again.
The requirements for obtaining this visa type are the same as that of the business visa. The fee is 14,865 Rupiah (US$100).
## Application requirements
The application requirements for the business visa are as follows:
  * A passport valid for between six months and six years depending on the length of the visa (minimum six months for a single-entry 60-day visa and minimum six years for a five-year multiple entry visa);
  * A letter of invitation from the Indonesian-based sponsor mentioning the purpose of the applicant’s visit, and length of stay. The Indonesian sponsor will also need to do an online application to the immigration office in Jakarta on behalf of the applicant;
  * A business cover letter from the applicant’s own company;
  * Two colored passport-sized photographs (white background; 4cm x 6cm);
  * A copy of the applicant’s round trip, electronic airline ticket; and
  * A bank statement proving the applicant has at least US$2,000.


## Working visas
A work visa (IMTA) can only be applied by the Indonesian company that will hire the foreign worker. The company must prove to the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) that the foreign applicant is required to fulfill certain positions.
Foreign employees in Indonesia are not allowed to obtain work in the following sectors:
  * Human resource management;
  * Industrial relation manager;
  * Personnel development manager;
  * Employee career development supervisor;
  * Job advisor;
  * Employee mediator;
  * Personnel recruitment supervisor;
  * Job interviewer;
  * Job training administrator;
  * Job analyst; and
  * Occupational safety specialist. 


### Foreign worker utilization plan
For a local company to employ a foreign worker, they must prepare a Foreign Worker Utilization Plan (Rencana Penggunaan Tenaga Kerja Asing (RPTKA)) — a document that details the specific work, position, and length of employment the foreign employee will undertake in Indonesia. The RPTKA now also serves as the basis for the MOM to grant visas and stay permits.
#### Types of RPTKA
There are four types of RPTKA
RPTKA Categories  
---  
RPTKA type |  Validity  
Temporary work (production quality control, filming work, installation of machines, etc) |  Valid for up to six months and cannot be extended  
Employment for more than six months |  Valid for up to two years with a possibility of extension  
Employment that does not require payment to the Foreign Worker Utilization Compensation Fund |  Valid for up to two years with a possibility for extension  
Employment in special economic zones (SEZ) |  Valid for five years with a possibility for extension; or The SEZ RPTKA for directors or commissioners can be granted for a period as needed by the employer  
### What is the process of hiring foreign workers in Indonesia?
It is the responsibility of the local company to apply for the RPTKA, which can be done through the online portal, under the Ministry of Manpower.
The application is addressed to the Director of Foreign Manpower Utilization Management (Direktur Pengendalian Penggunaan Tenaga Kerja Asing). However, if the application is for less than 50 foreign workers – then the application is addressed to the Director-General of Manpower Placement Guidance and Expansion of Work Opportunity (Direktur Jenderal Pembinaan Penempatan Tenaga Kerja dan Perluasan Kesempatan Kerja).
### Who can apply?
Employers that can employ foreign workers include:
  * Government institutions, international bodies, and foreign state representatives;
  * Foreign trade representatives, foreign news agencies conducting activities in Indonesia, and foreign representative offices;
  * Foreign private companies conducting business in Indonesia;
  * Legal entities such as private limited companies established in Indonesia;
  * Social, religious, or cultural institutions;
  * Entertainment management entities; and
  * Other business entities are allowed to employ foreign workers.

### RPTKA assessment
Once submitted, the MOM will conduct a feasibility study to see if the employer and prospective employee meet all the requirements. Employers are required to submit the following information:
  * Identity of the employer;
  * Reasons for utilizing a foreign worker;
  * The position of the foreign worker within the company’s organization structure;
  * Number of foreign workers being employed;
  * Contract length of the foreign employee;
  * The working location of the foreign employee;
  * Proof of mandatory employment reporting by the employer; and
  * Statement letter affirming the following: 
    * The designation of the Indonesian employee(s) assigned as a co-worker to the foreign employee;
    * The Indonesian employee(s) will receive training or education from the foreign employee in accordance with the position and qualifications of the foreign employee; and
    * Ensure the foreign worker returns to their home country once their work contract expires.
  * Future plans to absorb Indonesian workers.


The results of this assessment will be issued in no more than two working days.
### Personal information submission
The employer can submit the personal information and documents of the foreign worker after the RPTKA assessment or during the submission of the RPTKA documents. The personal information will be verified by the MOM within two working days.
### RPTKA approval and payment
If the documents and information declared to the MOM are correct and complete, the MOM will issue a payment notification letter for the amount of US$100 to the Foreign Workers Compensation Fund (_Dana Kompensasi Penggunaan Tenaga Kerja Asing_ or DKP-TKA). This amount is to be paid to the MOM every month.
Once the employer has made the payment, the MOM will issue the RPTKA approval and the data will be sent to the Ministry of Law and Human Rights, which will process the visa and stay permits. Payment of the DKP-TKA is waived for foreign state representatives, international bodies, religious institutions, social institutions, and certain positions in the education sector.
### Annual reporting obligations
Employers must submit an annual report to the MOM that covers the scope of the foreign worker’s employment, the education or training facilitated to Indonesian co-workers, and the types of technology transfer implemented.
### RPTKA exemptions
There are RPTKA exemptions for foreign workers who are members of the board of directors, members of the board of commissioners, diplomatic or consular staff, or are hired by the local employer in connection to emergency activities, vocational activities, or in connection to production activities of an Indonesian-based tech startup.

For tech-based startups and vocational training activities, the RPTKA exemption lasts for no more than three months, after which the company must apply for RPTKA approval. This application must be submitted at least two weeks before the expiration of the period of employment of the foreign worker, as stated in the foreign worker employment statement letter, which is issued in place of an RPTKA approval.
The MOM will issue the IMTA, and the immigration office will issue a limited-stay visa (VITAS). Upon arriving in Indonesia, the applicant must convert their VITAS into a limited stay permit Kartu Izin Tinggal Terbatas (KITAS).
#### Additional requirements to obtain a VITAS
Once a foreigner has received sponsorship to work in Indonesia, they can apply for a limited stay visa (Visa Tinggal Terbatas or ‘VITAS’). After the VITAS is secured, their immigration status changes to a limited stay permit (ITAS), which requires an official stamp from an immigration office.
After the VITAS is secured, their immigration status changes to an ITAS, which requires an official stamp from an immigration office.
Once the ITAS is secured, the foreign worker can receive a KITAS, which will permit them to work in Indonesia for up to 12 months. This can then be extended when the expiry date approaches.
#### The additional requirements to obtain a VITAS are:
  * A letter detailing the applicant is of good standing from the embassy or consulate of the foreigner’s country of origin; and
  * A health letter stating that the applicant is free from any contagious diseases.

### Length of limited stay permits
The limited stay permit (ITAS) is now valid for five years and can be extended once for another five years, meaning the foreigner can stay in the country in total for 10 years. Any ITAS for work purposes that is valid for no more than 90 days can be extended up to a maximum of 180 days.
Further, expatriates who have obtained their ITAS at a designated port of entry, such as airports and ports, will not be required to apply for the ITAS at their local immigration office in Indonesia, as was previously stipulated. This should ease the burden on expatriates and provide added certainty.
## Positions open for employment for expatriate workers
There are more than 2,000 job titles across 18 sectors that can now be filled by expatriates. The job titles are taken directly from the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO), issued by the International Labor Organization (ILO).
Sectors and Positions Open to Foreign Employees  
---  
Sector |  Number of positions available  
Construction |  181  
Real estate |  6

Procurement of electricity, gas, geothermal, and cool air |  40  
Miscellaneous services |  8  
Professional, scientific, and technical activities |  20  
## Permanent stay visas
The permanent stay visa (KITAP) allows expatriates to permanently stay in Indonesia. To qualify for this visa, expatriate workers would need to have held a KITAS for four consecutive years, work in the same company, and have the same position. As with other visas, applicants will need a local sponsor. In addition to their employer, this could also be their spouse (who must be Indonesian).
### Conversion of stay permits
Foreigners can now convert their visit stay permit to an ITAS, or an ITAS to a permanent stay permit (KITAP), or permanent stay visa/permanent residence. The KITAP is valid for five years and is extended automatically if the status of the expat does not change.
Obtaining a KITAP means the foreigner is no longer required to make the annual trip to the immigration office, as in the case of KITAS/ITAS holders, and no more costly visa extensions.
#### Introduction of the Second Home Category
The government has now allowed foreigners who treat Indonesia as a ‘second home category’ to be eligible to receive a VITAS. The applicant must show evidence that they have settled in Indonesia. Further requirements will be issued in upcoming government regulations.

# Indonesia’s Healthcare Industry: Growing Opportunities for Foreign Investors
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-healthcare-industry-growing-opportunities-for-foreign-investors)
  * _Indonesia’s healthcare industry presents a lucrative investment opportunity for foreign investors given its market size and government spending on universal healthcare._
  * _The implementation of the universal healthcare program, the largest in the world, has resulted in increased healthcare access and hence demand for hospitals, doctors, and medical equipment._
  * _The government has eased regulatory hurdles to give foreign investors a larger stake in certain sub-sectors of the industry, such as raw material production for pharmaceuticals, and hospitals._


Indonesia’s healthcare industry is a lucrative investment opportunity for foreign investors as the growth of its middle-class and the introduction of universal healthcare has driven demand in almost all aspects of the industry from hospitals to pharmaceuticals to medical devices.

[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-healthcare-industry-growing-opportunities-for-foreign-investors)Furthermore, by improving the country’s healthcare infrastructure, the government hopes this will encourage Indonesians who seek medical treatment abroad to spend domestically. More than 1.2 million Indonesians spend more than US$2 billion annually on healthcare overseas, mainly in neighboring Singapore and Malaysia.
## **Universal healthcare in Indonesia**
Indonesia introduced its universal healthcare program, the JKN, in 2014, which has since grown into the world’s largest, covering over 200 million people.
The program is run by the Social Security Administrator for Health (BPJS) agency, and every citizen as well as expats working in the country are mandated to join the program. All companies in the country are responsible for registering their employees and paying a percentage of their premiums.
Those registered with the BPJS program are eligible to receive free health services ranging from simple dental check-ups to serious procedures, such as organ transplant.
In the private sector, the employer must pay four percent and the employee the remaining one percent. For civil servants, the government contributes three percent while the employee contributes two percent.
In addition to the employee, the premium also covers their spouse and up to three dependent children up to the age of 21. Starting from June 2020, the government has been doubling premiums for the program, hoping this can reduce the program’s deficit which reached US$2.3 billion in 2019.
### _Private health insurance_
Roughly 20 million Indonesians are covered by private health insurance, although this is dwarfed by the number covered by the JKN program. Additionally, as businesses in the country are obligated to enroll their employees in the program, many have chosen not to participate in private health insurance schemes.
The ranks of those that can afford private insurance are increasing, as the middle and affluent-class demand faster and quality service. Private insurers will play an important role as an add-on to public coverage as the JKN, although providing a free service, will only pay up to the patient limit.
## **Structure of the pharmaceutical industry**
Indonesia’s pharmaceutical industry has experienced annual growth between 10-13 percent, boosted from the rollout of national health insurance. The policy has been a boon for the industry – ASEAN’s largest – which recorded more than US$9 billion in sales in 2019 and is expected to reach US$10 billion by 2021.
### _Generic drugs dominate_
Some 60 percent of the market is made up of prescription medicines and 40 percent from over the counter (OTC) drugs. However, the vast majority of both these medicines are generic drugs, which accounts for the largest segment of the pharmaceutical market; approximately 70 percent of the local drug market by volume or some US$700 million.
The JKN program has, in particular, boosted the sales of the country’s generic drug products, and the BPJS agency has mandated that up to 90 percent of the drugs on the Essential Medicines List, are to be generics. This industry is dominated by local producers, such as Kalbe Farma (the largest private pharmaceutical company in the region) and state-owned enterprises Kimia Farma and Biofarma who make up some 75 percent of the market share.
### _Dependency on import of raw materials an opportunity for foreign investors_
Some 90 percent of the raw materials used in drugs production, however, are imported, which prompted the government to amend the NIL to foreign investors 100 percent ownership of factories that produce these essential raw materials.
Despite the government encouraging the use of generic drugs to control costs, these types of medicines have a very low-profit margin, around 20 percent compared to 60 percent for branded medications. The industry is also not conducive for innovative drug makers for the near term due to low spending on research and development, a shortage of qualified scientists, and issues with enforcing patents and other intellectual property protection.
### _Impact of COVID-19 on drug makers_
Pharmaceutical firms were operating at 50 to 60 percent capacity as supply chains were disrupted, in particular, for the import of raw materials.
Companies that had the most diverse product portfolios, and were not reliant on a small number of drug products (especially specialist drugs), were more resilient in withstanding the market shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic⟨93⟩. The number of patients visiting hospitals for treatment for acute or chronic conditions slowly decreased during the pandemic, impacting companies that are built on a single product line.
### _Increasing potential for niche products_
In the long term, the pharmaceutical industry will see a surge in growth as demand increases for products used to treat lifestyle and chronic related diseases. Companies will need to find novel drug delivery areas as demand shifts from generic drugs and into niche products, such as dietary supplements and other aspects of biopharmaceuticals.
## **Market for hospitals and healthcare facilities**
Indonesia has 2,925 hospitals providing just over 318,000 beds, or 1.17 beds per thousand population – the lowest rate in ASEAN.
Some 63 percent of the country’s hospitals are privately managed, and the low number of hospital beds reflects the growing opportunity for foreign investors to fill the shortfall. There is an increasing demand for new hospitals in second-tier cities such as Surabaya and Bandung as more of the population engage with the universal healthcare program.
There are currently more than 26,000 healthcare facilities where patients can get medical treatment under the JKN program. This includes over 2,000 hospitals, 9,000 community health centers and private clinics, over 1,100 dentist clinics, and 1,000 opticians.
The government has allowed foreign investors to have 67 percent ownership in private hospitals and 70 percent ownership for investors from ASEAN. This is also the case for private health clinics, although foreign investors are limited to **specialized** medical services and not basic medical clinic services.
The main challenges for hospital operators will be recruiting doctors (the country only has 0.4 doctors per 1,000 population) in addition to choosing the right location to build the hospitals. The opportunity lies in second tier cities as bed occupancy is still low and thus there is potential for growth. Furthermore, second tier cities offer lower property prices and hence profitability is usually higher than in first tier areas such as Jakarta.
Investors should closely work with reputable medical schools and vocational schools and provide access to high-quality equipment and training. Hospitals are also advised to allow specialists to work in other practices/hospitals, enabling them to expand their skillset and experience.
## **Telemedicine investment outlook**
The integration of information and communication technology (ICT) into healthcare will also accelerate reforms in Indonesia’s healthcare sector. The use of healthcare apps, for instance, could transform the way hospitals and doctors store their records, collect, and share patient data.
The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the growth of digital healthcare and will become the new norm in the region post-COVID-19. Local healthcare app, Alodokter, recorded more than 30 million active users since March 2020 (one and a half times higher than pre-COVID-19 traffic). Another telemedicine app, Halodoc, as well as ride-haling giant, GoJek, partnered with the Ministry of Health to provide COVID-19 diagnostics in remote areas.
In a country that has only 0.4 doctors per 1,000 population, in addition to geography of over 17,000 islands, telemedicine makes healthcare accessible to the furthest regions and helps mitigate pressure on the existing healthcare system.
The government has also sought to improve connectivity in the archipelago through the completion of the Palapa Ring Project⟨94⟩, which aimed to provide access to 4G internet services to more than 500 regencies across the country. Costing US$1.5 billion to complete, the project comprised of 35,000km (21,747 miles) of undersea fiber-optic cables and 21,000km (13,000 miles) of land cables, stretching from the westernmost city in Indonesia, Sabang to the easternmost town, Merauke. Additionally, the cables also transverse every district from the northernmost island, Mianagas, to the southernmost island, Rote. 
## **Medical devices industry**
Indonesia’s medical device industry is worth an estimated US$4.5 billion in 2019 with the majority (US$2.8 billion) coming from imported products.
Imported products are largely sophisticated medical instruments, such as diagnostic tools and medical lasers. By contrast, exports of medical devices reached less than US$267 million in 2019, dominated by low added-value products, such as masks, surgical gloves, and hospital furniture.
Foreign investors are limited to 49 percent ownership and must apply for a special license from the Ministry of Health (MoH) to supply high-tech medical equipment sector. For the majority of low-tech medical equipment, the MoH will only issue a license on a case by case basis.
Demand for medical devices will be driven by the expansion of private and government hospitals and clinics as well as improvements on existing facilities. Another factor behind this expected demand is the rise of non-communicable diseases and the diagnosing of which require advanced and high-tech equipment.
It is expected that the ability of foreign manufacturers to import medical devices will become less cumbersome, especially as the government continues to reform regulations on ease of doing business. Further, Indonesia is also a member of the ASEAN Medical Device Directive (AMDD), a set of directives that aim to harmonize regulations across the region and require medical device manufacturers to register their devices in any member state where they have production.
Established foreign firms who already have a foothold in the country are Siemens, GE Healthcare, and Pfizer. These companies have greatly benefited from the rollout of the JKN program for equipment such as MRI machines, PET-CT scanners, and ICU equipment, among others.

# Indonesia Issues Implementing Regulation for E-commerce Sector: Key Features
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-issues-implementing-regulation-for-e-commerce-sector-key-features)
  * _In May 2020, Indonesia issued Regulation 50 of 2020, which is an implementing regulation for the country’s Law on E-commerce._
  * _The regulation provides legal guidelines for the establishment of e-commerce entities for domestic and international businesses._
  * _Foreign e-commerce organizers, such as online marketplaces, must establish a representative office in Indonesia if they completed more than 1,000 transactions with local consumers._


On May 19, 2020, Indonesia’s Ministry of Trade issued _Reg 50/2020_), which sets out the legal guidelines for domestic and international businesses engaging in trade through electronic systems (e-commerce). _Reg 50/2020_ serves as an implementing regulation to _Reg 80/2019_⟨93⟩, Indonesia’s first-ever law on e-commerce, which was issued in November 2019.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-issues-implementing-regulation-for-e-commerce-sector-key-features)In line with _Reg 80/2019_ , _Reg 50/2020_ describes the three types of e-commerce entities or internet companies that will be subject to tax laws and business licensing regulations, namely; merchants, e-commerce organizers, and intermediary service organizers. Additionally, the regulation also sets out the criteria for foreign e-commerce players to be obligated to establish a foreign representative office in Indonesia.
While _Reg 80/2019_ and _Reg 50/2020_ are not tax regulations, the potential tax impacts would be far-reaching, considering Indonesia’s e-commerce sector is set to be valued at US$100 billion in 2025, compared to US$28 billion in 2018.
Businesses have been given until November 2021 to adjust their operations and adhere to the new provisions.
## **What are the business entities described in the regulations?**
Both regulations describe three e-commerce entities based on their business activities. These are:
  * Merchants (sellers): Businesses or individuals that conduct electronic offerings through electronic systems either managed or owned by themselves or through an e-commerce organizer;
  * E-commerce organizers (PPMSE): Businesses or individuals that provide electronic systems to facilitate e-commerce transactions. These include business models, such as online streaming platforms, online marketplaces, online classified advertisements, and price comparison platforms, among others; and
  * Intermediary Service Organizers (PSP): These are businesses or individuals that provide search system facilities (for example, Google, Bing) or those that provide information storage services (hosting and caching).


The aforementioned entities can be either domestic or foreign businesses and the legal requirements for each type will also differ.
### _Domestic merchants_
Domestic merchants must obtain a business license from the government’s 
### _Domestic e-commerce organizers_
Businesses who operate their own e-commerce facilities are classified as PPMSEs and must obtain a special license named, _Surat Izin Usaha Perdagangan melalui Sistem Elektronik_(business license for trading through an electronic system (SIUPMSE).
The SIUPMSE can be applied through the OSS system and businesses will need to adhere to certain criteria to be eligible. These are:
  * Obtaining an Electronic System Provider certificate within 14 days after the SIUPMSE is issued;
  * Must provide a website and/or application name to the government;
  * Must establish a consumer complaints section on their website/application, which includes e-mail address and contact number in addition to the details of the Directorate-General of Consumer Protection and Trade Compliance;
  * The PPMSE must provide facilities that inform or link customers to the OSS Agency’s website; and
  * The business must submit its transaction data (subscribers, payments, complaints, contracts, shipments etc.) to Statistics Indonesia (BPS), the government agency responsible for conducting statistical surveys.


### _Foreign merchants_
Foreign merchants must provide a valid business license issued in the country where they are established to the domestic PPSME company which provides their electronic communication facilities. The domestic PPSME will then need to report all the transactional activities (subscribers, payments, complaints, contracts, shipments etc.) of the foreign merchant to the BPS.
### _Foreign e-commerce organizers_
Foreign PPSMEs are obligated to establish a representative office in Indonesia; however, this would only apply if:
  * The PPSME has completed over 1,000 transactions with Indonesian consumers within a year; or
  * Has delivered over 1,000 packages to Indonesian consumers with a year.


The PPSME will need to establish a specific type of representative office, namely, a representative office for a foreign trading company (KP3A).
The KP3A is divided into the following categories:
  * Can act as a buying/or selling agent for the parent company, performing liaising, or promotional activities; or
  * Act as a manufacturing agent with its activities also limited to market research and liaising.


To establish a KP3A, the company will first need to obtain a Foreign Company Trade Representative license (SIUP3A), which can be done through the OSS system. There are several requirements for this, which are:
  * Evidence that the company is being appointed as a representative of the parent company. This must be legalized by a notary and should be accompanied by a clarification letter issued by the trade attaché of the Indonesian embassy in their country of origin;
  * Must provide evidence of the Article of Association/incorporation of the company which will need to be legalized by a notary and officially translated to the Indonesian language;
  * Provide proof of identity of who will be managing the representative office; and
  * Provide the number and details of local workers to be hired along with their employment certificates/contracts.


As with the other types of e-commerce entities, the PPSME must submit their data to the BPS as well as provide a link that informs and connects their website to the OSS Agency’s own website. 
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-issues-implementing-regulation-for-e-commerce-sector-key-features)Further, the PPSME must establish a consumer complaints service, which includes contact details that customers can use in addition to the contact details of the Directorate-General of Consumer Protection and Trade Compliance.
### _Intermediary service organizers_
_Reg 50/2020_ does not differentiate between domestic and foreign PSPs and both must secure a SIUPMSE license from the OSS Agency.
They have to adhere to the following conditions:
  * They must not be direct beneficiaries of e-commerce transitions; and
  * Are not allowed to be involved in any contractual obligations between parties engaging in e-commerce activities.


## **Online advertisements**
E-commerce businesses are permitted to distribute online advertisements provided they comply to applicable laws and regulations in Indonesia.
The regulation does state several requirements online advertisements should satisfy. These include:
  * Must not deceive consumers on the quality, prices, materials, and quantity, or other false and incorrect information for the goods/service being provided;
  * Must not provide false claims with regards to warranties or guarantees;
  * The company must provide the usage risks for the said goods/services being advertised; and
  * All electronic advertisements should have an exit function, such as through a ‘skip’ or ‘close’ button to close the advertisement.


Consumers can make complaints for ads that are not incompliance with the relevant laws and regulations through the Director-General of Consumer Protection and Trade Compliance.

# Indonesia’s Manufacturing Sector: Practical Information for Investors
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-manufacturing-sector-practical-information-for-investors)
  * _Indonesia’s manufacturing sector has historically played a key role in the country’s economic development._
  * _The majority of businesses in the manufacturing sector are mostly located on the island of Java. The island accounts for 60 percent of the population and 58 percent of GDP._
  * _The main manufacturing hubs are in the provinces of West Java, Central Java province, East Java, and Banten._


Indonesia’s manufacturing sector has historically played a key role in the country’s economic development and now contributes to 20 percent of GDP.
The government has ambitious plans to propel the country into the top ten biggest economies in the world by 2030, with manufacturing at the heart of this goal. The main areas of production include textiles and garments, food and beverages (F&B), electronics, automotive, and chemicals, with the majority of manufacturers in this sector comprising of micro, small, or medium-sized enterprises.
The sector has posted a consistent four percent growth year-on-year since 2016 and registered 147 trillion rupiah (US$8.9 billion) in investments from January to September 2019. However, labor productivity within this sector remains low compared with other ASEAN peers and this can be seen by the low-tech contribution of manufacturing to exports.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-manufacturing-sector-practical-information-for-investors)The government is aiming to increase employment in this sector to 20 percent of the total workforce by 2024 through the export of more high-value and complex manufacturing products, particularly in electronics, chemical products, and new high-tech technologies. This new initiative is part of the ‘Making Indonesia 4.0’ roadmap.
As such, both domestic and international investments will be crucial to this strategy. This article will provide some practical tips for manufacturers looking to expand or invest in the country.
## **A Java-centric sector**
Investors should note that the majority of businesses in the manufacturing sector are mostly located on the island of Java. The island accounts for 60 percent of the population and 58 percent of GDP; it is also where the capital is situated.
Logistics and infrastructure are also more developed here than on the other islands with major land and seaports easily accessible to manufacturers. Additionally, more than half of the 100 or so industrial estates are located on the island. The main manufacturing hubs on the island are in the provinces of West Java, Central Java province, East Java, and Banten.
### _West Java_
Some 60 percent of Indonesia’s manufacturing activities are located in West Java province, ranging from textiles, F&B, automotive, aviation, and electronics. Its top-three exports were machinery, electronics, and electric equipment with automotive, F&B, and industrial estates receiving the most direct domestic (DDI) and foreign direct investment (FDI). FDI into the province reached US$2.2 billion in 2019.
The region presents huge potential for investments in livestock, plantations, and agriculture since the province’s fertile volcanic soil produces 70 percent of national tea production and around 20 percent of total rice production.
### _Central Java_
The manufacturing sector contributes to 30 percent of the GDP of Central Java province. It has become particularly popular with investors engaging in textiles and garment manufacturing with 56 percent of inward textile investment going into the province. Other sectors include food and wood processing, and the non-metallic mineral industry.
Some 21 trillion rupiah (US$US$1.2 billion) worth of DDI and FDI was realized in 2019. The province also contains four international airports, 11 seaports, and more than 3,000 km (1,800 miles) of national and provincial roads. The province is also known for its teak wood
### _East Java_
East Java province has a number of large industries, which includes the largest shipbuilding yard in Indonesia. Moreover, the province contains the largest cement factory in the country.
Major manufacturing sectors also encompass the food industry, machinery, leather goods, and furniture. An estimated 12 trillion rupiah (US$732 million) of DDI and FDI was realized in 2019.
### _Banten_
The province is rich in mineral sources, such as gold, coal, phosphate, and opals, among others. State-owned steel manufacturer PT Krakatau Posco produces some three million tons of steel with other major industries in the province covering chemicals, automotive, and F&B.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-manufacturing-sector-practical-information-for-investors)The Merak seaport is a key transport link between the islands of Java and Sumatra. The port also services one of the largest petrochemical facilities. The country’s main international airport is also located in this province.
The cities of Tangerang, South Tangerang, and Cilegon, accounts for almost two-thirds of gross regional domestic product (GRDP), because of their export-oriented processing industries. The province also received 12 trillion rupiah (US$732 million) of DDI and FDI in 2019.
## **Minimum wages**
Based on Minister of Labor  _(Reg 7, 2013),_ ‘leading sectors or industries’ in a province, can determine their own minimum wage rate⟨93⟩, also known as UMSP.
For a sector to be considered leading, it will need to fulfill the following criteria:
  * The specific industry can generate added value to the local economy;
  * The proposed UMSP must be higher than the provincial minimum wage (usually by 5 percent and above);
  * Involves a large number of businesses;
  * The industry requires significant manpower;
  * The industry is export-orientated; and
  * The related trade and labor unions are in agreement with the proposal.


The industries that have been covered by the UMSP have included:
  * Public works;
  * Automotive manufacturing;
  * Tourism;
  * Telecommunications;
  * Retail;
  * Food and beverages;
  * Pharmaceutical and healthcare;
  * Finance and banking;
  * Textile manufacturing;
  * Chemicals, energy and mining; and
  * Electronics and machinery.


Investors should note that these industries vary from province to province as does the UMSP rate.

# Indonesia Bans the Export of Palm Oil, Impacting Global Food Prices
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-bans-the-export-of-palm-oil-impacting-global-food-prices)
As of April 28, 2022, Indonesia has begun a complete ban on palm oil exports, a move that could threaten global food prices and place extra pressure on already steep cooking oil prices worldwide. The ban comes as Indonesia gripes with domestic cooking oil shortages and reins in high prices triggering recent protests in the country. Ironically, Indonesia is the world’s largest producer of crude palm oil (CPO).
The Indonesian government acknowledged that the palm oil export ban will hurt international consumers but deemed it necessary to lower the price of domestic, branded cooking oil, which soared from 14,000 to 15,000 rupiah (US$0.96 to US$1.03) per liter to over 22,000 rupiah (US$1.52) per liter. President Joko Widodo said in his statement on April 27 that the ban would be lifted once local demand was met and prices stabilized.
Palm oil is by far the most consumed and traded edible oil in the world. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, 77 million tons of palm oil are expected to be produced this year – with Indonesia accounting for around 60 percent of the global supply share. Malaysia ranks second with a 25 percent supply share.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-bans-the-export-of-palm-oil-impacting-global-food-prices)Grown only in the tropics, the oil palm tree produces a high-quality oil that is used as a common ingredient in cosmetic and household items, such as detergents, margarine, soaps, chocolates, cakes, and cleaning products, and biofuels, among others.
## The global cooking oil chaos
External global demand for CPO in addition to Indonesia’s growing biodiesel (B-30) activity during 2020 had already put pressure on CPO prices. In November 2021, global CPO prices reached US$1,300 per ton; currently, the price has hovered around US$1,600 per ton.
Further, other edible oils have seen production disrupted due to a variety of factors.
### Sunflower seed oil
The recent Russia-Ukraine crisis —also contributed to the increase of CPO as shipments from the conflict region slumped. Both countries account for 55 percent of global sunflower oil output.
Between September 2021 and March 2022, sunflower oil prices have seen a 
Buyers have turned to palm oil as an alternative for the lost supply of sunflower oil from the Black Sea region.
### Soybean oil
Global prices of soybean oil have seen record highs on concerns about Indonesia’s palm oil ban. Argentina, the largest exporter of soybean oil, temporarily halted exports of the oil in March 2022 to control domestic food inflation. The country eventually imposed a hike in export tax to 33 percent from 31 percent.
In addition, dry weather in Argentina and Brazil (another major producer of soybean oil) has affected output.
### Rapeseed oil
Canada, the largest producer of canola oil (a type of rapeseed oil) in the world was impacted by a drought in 2021, which reduced oil supplies for 2022.
### US-China trade war
The US-China trade war led China to switch to palm oil as it looked to reduce its reliance on American soybean oil.
### Indonesia’s changing palm oil policies
To counter the impact of external pressures, the Indonesian government introduced a domestic market obligation (DMO) scheme in January 2022. Under the DMO, palm oil producers had to allocate 20 percent of their planned exports to the domestic market. In addition, the government also tried to impose a fixed price for domestic sales.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-bans-the-export-of-palm-oil-impacting-global-food-prices)However, the problem became more complicated with the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and cooking oil became scarce. Further, raids conducted by the police found warehouses hoarding cooking oil.
On March 9, 2022, the government decided to increase the DMO allocation to 30 percent. However, less than two weeks later, the government announced a policy U-turn by removing the DMO restrictions and raising its export levy instead. Under the levy scheme, the maximum tax bill for CPO exports was raised to US$375 per ton, which when combined with custom duties, raised the overall palm oil export tax to US$675 per ton. At the time, the government said it would use the proceeds to subsidize bulk cooking oil. However, domestic prices continued to climb, but cooking oil was now in abundance in supermarkets and outlets.
The government eventually intervened again and announced a blanket ban. Critics have noted the huge financial implications of the loss from tax revenues will be large. The country exported US$28.52 billion in 2021, from which 44 percent came from refined palm olein.
### Global impact
India, China, Pakistan, and Spain are the main destinations for Indonesia’s palm oil and news of the ban has sent these countries scrambling for alternative sources. Malaysia is the second-largest producer in the world but is struggling to fill the gap due to labor shortages.
India receives 50 percent of its crude palm oil from Indonesia, amounting to 8 million tons per year. With the ban, edible oils, which are already at an all-time high, are expected to increase further. India is already the world's largest importer of vegetable oils.
Global brands are also expected to be impacted by the ban. In 2020, Nestle bought some 
Other global brands that are highly dependent on palm oils include L’Oréal, Ferrero, Danone, and Unilever, and could see their costs rise so long as the ban continues.
## Can Malaysia fill the supply gap?
Indonesia’s palm oil ban is advantageous for Malaysia due to higher prices with 
However, the country is looking unlikely to make up the supply shock as it suffers from a labor shortage. Output growth in Malaysia slumped to a five-year low last year as palm oil companies struggled to find enough foreign workers for harvesting jobs, which are considered dirty, and demeaning by locals. Some 80 percent of plantation workers in Malaysia are foreigners; the majority are from Indonesia.
With the palm oil fruit being harvested once every 10 to 14 days, the shortage of labor has forced smallholder farmers to harvest the fruit once every month. Many plantations, desperate for workers, tried to attract local workers with higher wages, free housing, and subsidized utilities. However, the 
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-bans-the-export-of-palm-oil-impacting-global-food-prices)The government froze the hiring of migrant workers over the last two years to stem the spread of COVID-19. Currently, it is in the process of speeding up the approval of up to 180,000 foreign workers to ease the labor shortage. 
The labor shortage crisis has prompted Malaysian palm oil companies to increase investments in automation and artificial intelligence along the supply chain and reduce their dependence on foreign labor in the coming decade.
## Reforming Indonesia’s palm oil sector
The sudden shifts in high domestic prices will continue to plague Indonesia’s palm oil industry unless real reforms are enacted. A major issue is that nearly half of the domestic market for cooking oil is controlled by four conglomerates, who also have businesses throughout the supply chain from cooking oil refineries to processing mills.

# Indonesia’s Just Energy Transition Partnership: Impacts for the Green Economy
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-just-energy-transition-partnership-impacts-for-the-green-economy)
**_The Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) between Indonesia and its international partners calls for renewable energy to comprise 34 percent of Indonesia’s power generation by 2030._**
**_Indonesia will receive an initial US$20 billion over the next three to five years to help phase out coal energy and invest in renewable energy infrastructure._**
* * *
Indonesia recently launched the most ambitious energy transition program in its history as part of an international partnership to combat climate change.
The program, known as the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP), will see an initial US$20 billion mobilized over the next three to five years toward Indonesia’s adoption of renewable energy.
Indonesia and its international partners, including the US, the EU, Japan, and Canada, launched the JETP at the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment event at the G20 Summit in November 2022.
The JETP stands to channel billions of dollars to help Indonesia pivot from fossil fuels. The program is poised to create new momentum for Indonesia’s relatively nascent but emerging green economy as the country makes addressing climate concerns a growing priority.
## The JETP model for climate action
The JETP is a new model for international cooperation on country-specific efforts to combat climate change. The JETP model combines public and private investments to assist with climate financing for developing countries, particularly to transition energy generation away from fossil fuels. In addition to driving energy transition, the JETP model seeks to promote the green economy and address the economic and social needs of communities that are vulnerable to the effects of energy transitions.
The first JETP was made in 2021 at the COP26 Summit between South Africa and several international partners, worth an initial US$8.5 billion. Indonesia is just the second country to receive a JETP. Vietnam and India will likely be the following two countries to receive a JETP.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-just-energy-transition-partnership-impacts-for-the-green-economy)In practice, Indonesia’s JETP will consist of a mix of concessional loans, market-based loans, grants, guarantees, and private investments from public and private entities. Together, they will provide financing to assist Indonesia phase out coal energy, investing in renewable energy infrastructure, and supporting affected communities to adapt to the transition.
Indonesia’s JETP is jointly led by the US and Japan and is supported by the UK, Germany, France, the EU, Canada, Italy, Norway, and Denmark. Of the JETP’s initial US$20 billion in the financing, US$10 billion will come from public sector pledges and US$10 billion will be mobilized from a set of private sector financial institutions.
In addition to government funding, loans from international institutions like the World Bank will account for a portion of the public financing. Private sector financing will be coordinated by the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, which includes Bank of America, Citi, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Macquarie, MUFG, and Standard Chartered.
## Accelerating climate goals under the JETP
The JETP makes up part of Indonesia’s commitments to keep global warming within a limit of 1.5 °C. To meet this global objective, the JETP will set country-specific targets for Indonesia to reduce its emissions and eventually become carbon neutral. Many of these targets move forward the timelines of previous climate goals.
Some of the key objectives under the JETP include:
  * Reach peak power sector emissions by 2030, approximately seven years ahead of the previous schedule, leading to a cumulative reduction of over 300 megatons in greenhouse gas emissions through 2030 and over 2 gigatons through 2060.
  * Cap power sector emissions at 290 megatons of CO2 in 2030, down from the baseline value of 357 megatons of CO2.
  * Reach net zero emissions in the power sector by 2050, moving this target forward by 10 years.
  * Have at least 34 percent of all power generation comprised of renewable energy by 2030, approximately doubling the renewable energy deployment of previous plans.
  * Accelerate the widespread deployment of energy efficiency and electrification tools, technologies, and reforms.
  * Accelerate the development of a vibrant and competitive local industry in renewable energy and energy efficiency, including by investing in local technological capacity and knowledge in collaboration with international partners.
  * Accelerate the early retirement of coal-fired power plants.
  * Restrict the development of captive coal-fired power plants.


The JETP launch announcement also includes details on immediate steps over the next six months. These steps include developing a policy reform strategy and a private sector engagement strategy. These strategies will provide a framework for improving the environment for energy transition and directing JETP investments on the ground, with each project addressing Indonesia’s diverse energy transition needs.
## Increased climate urgency in Indonesia
In recent years, the Indonesian government has made transitioning to renewable energy and addressing climate change increasingly urgent concerns. As an archipelagic nation, Indonesia is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. However, it is also a developing country that is partially dependent on fossil fuels to grow its economy.
Indonesia has committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2060 and is working on its _Long-Term Strategy for Low Carbon and Climate Resilience to 2050._ In September 2022, the Indonesian government issued a regulation – the Presidential Decree on Renewable Energy – that encourages the use of renewables and plans for the early retirement of some coal plants.
Although Indonesia has committed to numerous climate goals, in practice the country has struggled to achieve them. Indonesia committed to having **renewables⟨93⟩** contribute to 23 percent of its energy composition by 2025, but this figure currently sits at just 12 percent. Moreover, it is the world’s largest exporter of coal, and coal is responsible for about 60 percent of its own electricity generation.
In September 2022, Erick Thohir, Indonesia’s Minister for State-Owned Enterprises, said that retiring 15 gigawatts of coal power generation over the next three decades requires US$600 billion in capital support. The JETP, then, is a step towards meeting these needs.
The Indonesian government has made the development of its green economy a crucial part of both its energy transition and economic development strategies. In addition to transitioning Indonesia’s energy composition, the JETP stands to improve the business environment for Indonesia’s green economy by building infrastructure for renewables and improving financing vehicles for sustainable projects.
For instance, in 2021, the Indonesian government **announced plans⟨94⟩** to create the world’s largest green industrial park. The Indonesian government is **looking⟨95⟩** at areas like electric vehicles (EVs) and their batteries as new sectors for economic growth.
As such, Indonesia’s embrace of climate action is poised to accelerate the development of its emerging green economy. As the JETP necessitates the Indonesian government to undertake reforms to encourage renewable energy, more reforms relating to the green economy are likely to occur throughout 2023.

# Indonesia’s Omnibus Law: New Provisions for the Shipping Sector
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-omnibus-law-new-provisions-for-the-shipping-sector)
Indonesia’s Government Regulation 31 of 2021 (Reg 31/2021) — an implementing regulation of the Omnibus Law⟨93⟩ — amends several aspects of the country’s shipping law.
A major amendment is the removal of several categories of business licenses. Starting from business licenses for all activities in every sector will be issued based on the business risk level⟨94⟩. This risk-based business licensing system has already been introduced under the Omnibus Law and will see the government conduct risk analysis of each application before issuing a business license.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-omnibus-law-new-provisions-for-the-shipping-sector)The Indonesian government hopes the enactment of the new shipping regulation will attract more foreign investors into the country’s shipping industry, particularly as President Joko Widodo intends to transform Indonesia into a global maritime axis.
To realize this objective, the government has begun improving inter-island connectivity and upgrading port infrastructure – a huge and complex task considering the Indonesian archipelago spans over 6 million square kilometers and consists of over 17,000 islands. An inter-connected archipelago will boost trade and commerce in the more remote islands and develop new markets for marine-based fisheries and maritime tourism.
## A centralized business licensing system
A centralized system with oversight by the central government will help simplify the business licensing regime so that relevant permits can be processed under one framework.
Previously, all licenses and approvals related to port activities were issued by the Ministry of Transport (MoT). In addition, vessels operating in Indonesia had to obtain multiple certifications for safety to seaworthiness from a multitude of institutions, such as local port authorities, the Sub-Directorate of Vessel Pollution Prevention, and Safety Management (under the MoT), and a classification agency, also under the MoT.
## Retention of the cabotage rule
The Omnibus Law keeps the cabotage rule which requires the domestic transportation of goods and passengers to be undertaken only by Indonesian-flagged vessels with an Indonesian crew.
However, the Omnibus Law does add a provision in which foreign-flagged vessels can conduct other activities in Indonesian waters if Indonesian-flagged vessels are unavailable or not sufficient.
The MoT has an exhaustive list of the types of activities for which foreign-flagged vessels can be used, namely:
  * Salvage and underwater works;
  * Offshore construction;
  * Oil and gas survey;
  * Drilling;
  * Dredging;
  * Terminal construction; and
  * Offshore operational support.


## Foreign ownership restrictions
Under another implementing regulation, Presidential Regulation 10 of 2021⟨95⟩ (PR 10/2021) — also dubbed as the positive investment list and liberalizes foreign ownership limitations in most sectors — places a 49 percent restriction on foreign ownership in marine shipping activities.
The activities include:
  * Domestic liner and tramp activities;
  * Domestic sea transport for tourism;
  * Domestic sea transport for special goods;
  * Domestic liner and tramp sea freight for goods;
  * Overseas liner and tramp sea freight for goods;
  * Public ferry transport between provinces;
  * Lake and river transport for tourism with a fixed route; and
  * Lake and river transport for general goods and animals, among others.


The extensive list can be found here⟨95⟩.
## Removing the requirement of appointing a general agent for foreign shipping companies
Foreign shipping companies can conduct their activities without requiring a general agent. If required, they can establish a domestic company in Indonesia⟨96⟩. Previously, foreign shipping companies were mandatorily required to appoint a domestic shipping company or a special sea transportation company as a general agent if they wanted to conduct shipping activities at a port or terminal open to international trade in Indonesia. GR 31/2021 has revoked this requirement.
## Provisions on the ownership of Indonesian-flagged vessels
GR 31/2021 adds three conditions for the ownership of Indonesian-flagged vessels. These are:
  * The vessel can only be owned by an Indonesian citizen or a legal entity established in Indonesia and is domiciled in Indonesia;
  * The vessel must have a minimum gross displacement of 7 GT; and
  * If the vessel is owned by an entity under a joint venture, the majority shareholder must be an Indonesian citizen.


## Port activities
The central government, through the Omnibus Law, has centralized the licensing regime for port-related activities including building permits and business licenses for port services. Further, it is the central government and not the MoT that regulates which ports are open for international trading in Indonesia.
GR 31/2021 provides details on the types of activities allowed in ports and the type of entities that can construct and operate them. A port can be constructed and operated by a port business entity (Badan Usaha Pelabuhan – BUP), or a government agency, which can be a port administrator unit (Unit Penyelenggara Pelabuhan) or a port authority (Otoritas Pelabuhan).
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-omnibus-law-new-provisions-for-the-shipping-sector)GR 31/2021 makes minimal changes to the types of activities a BUP can undertake but the regulation does add provisions on stevedoring (loading or offloading cargo to and/from a ship). Under the regulation, BUPs must have a partnership with a local stevedoring company; this is intended to support domestic micro, small and medium-scale enterprises (MSMEs).
A BUP can provide stevedoring services in certain types of terminals, namely, ro-ro terminals, container terminals, liquid bulk terminals, and dry bulk terminals.
## Sanctions
According to GR 31/2021, the following sanctions can be imposed on businesses that violate the shipping law:
  * Written warnings;
  * Freezing business activities;
  * Revocation of the business license; and
  * Administrative fines.


The Omnibus Law has increased the fines by approximately 30 to 50 percent, the highest of which is the fine of 10 billion rupiah (US$698,000) (from 200 million rupiah (US$13,967) for not removing cargo from shipwrecks by the shipowner.

# Increased Oversight in Indonesia’s Peer-to-Peer Lending Sector
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/increased-oversight-in-indonesia-s-peer-to-peer-lending-sector)
**_Indonesia has increased oversight in its peer-to-peer lending sector through OJK Regulation No. 10/POJK.05/2022. The regulation increases the minimum capital and equity requirements for P2P lenders and sets out a more efficient licensing procedure._**
* * *
The rapid growth of Indonesia’s peer-to-peer (P2P) lending industry has led to a rise in illegal online lenders and concerns over their intimidatory debt-collecting practices and the collection of personal data. In response, Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority, or OJK, issued OJK Regulation No. 10/POJK.05/2022 (POJK 10/2022) in July 2022, which aims to crack down on illegal and financially unhealthy fintech players by introducing new capital requirements, revamping the licensing regime, and introducing minimum equity requirements.
Indonesia’s P2P industry disbursed an estimated 250 trillion rupiah (US$17 billion) in loans in 2022, an increase from the estimated 155 trillion rupiah (US$10.2 billion) disbursed throughout 2021.
## How much are Indonesia's minimum capital and equity requirements for P2P lenders?
A P2P lender must have a minimum paid-up capital of 25 billion rupiah (US$1.6 million), a significant increase from the 2.5 billion rupiah (US$165,000) stipulated in previous regulations.
The OJK has also mandated P2P lenders to maintain equity of at least 12.5 billion rupiah (US$828,000). The fulfillment of this requirement must be done in the following tranches:
  * At least 2.5 billion rupiah (US$165,000) within one year after the enactment of POJK 10/2022;
  * At least 7.5 billion rupiah (US$497,000) within two years after the enactment of POJK 10/2022; and
  * At least 12.5 billion rupiah (US$828,000) within three two years after the enactment of POJK 10/2022.


P2P operators that obtained or were in the process of obtaining their license from the OJK before the issuance of POJK 10/2022 would be grandfathered and not be subject to the changes under POJK 10/2022.
## Licensing
Previously, a P2P operator seeking to establish in Indonesia had to register their business with the OJK. They then had to apply for a business license to the OJK within one year of registration. POJK 10/2022 has revamped the licensing procedure by removing the registration phase; thus, P2P lenders only need to obtain a license from the OJK.
However, a new requirement now is that the P2P lender must be registered as an Electronic System Operator (ESO) with the Ministry of Communication and Informatics. The ESO registration must be completed within 30 calendar days from the issuance of the business license from the OJK.
## Controlling shareholders
POJK 10/2022 recognizes the concept of a controlling shareholder and must appoint at least one controlling shareholder. The regulation defines a controlling shareholder as any legal entity, individual, or business group that:
  * Owns 25 percent or more of a P2P lender’s issued shares or voting rights; or
  * Owns less than 25 percent of a P2P lender’s issued shares or voting rights but where it is proven the shareholder exercises control either directly or indirectly of the P2P lender.


P2P operators that have obtained a license from the OJK prior to POJK 10/2022 were given six months to notify the OJK of their controlling shareholder(s) after enactment of the regulation.
### Lock-up period
After obtaining a license from the OJK, the P2P operator is barred from having new shareholders or changing its controlling shareholder for a period of three years.
### Fit and proper test
Members of the board of directors, controlling shareholders, and members of the board of commissioners must undergo the OJK’s ‘fit and proper’ test. The mentioned primary parties are barred from carrying out their responsibilities before passing the test.
### Competency certification
Executives, directors, and commissioners must be certified by a financial technology certification agency registered with the OJK.
## OJK expands the list of corporate actions that require approvals
The OJK has expanded the list of corporate actions that require prior approval. These are:
  * Conducting mergers and consolidations;
  * Change in ownership;
  * Increase in paid-up capital; and
  * Changes in the board of directors and commissioners.


## Legal lending limit
The maximum loan amount a borrower can receive is 2 billion rupiah (US$132,000).
Further, POJK 10/2022 has also set a maximum lending limit for a P2P operator and its affiliates to 25 percent of the P2P operator’s final lending position at the end of each month.
For example, if a P2P lender grants a total of 50 billion rupiah (US$3.3 million) to borrowers by the end of the month, then it can only grant 12.5 billion rupiah (US$828,000). This will apply in stages.
Timeline |  Lending limit  
---|---  
6 months after any given month |  80 percent of the total loan disbursed by the P2P operator and its affiliates by the end of the sixth month (commencing from July 4, 2022)  
12 months after any given month |  50 percent of the total loan disbursed by the P2P operator and its affiliates by the end of the 12th month (commencing from July 4, 2022)  
18 months after any given month |  25 percent of the total loan disbursed by the P2P operator and its affiliates by the end of the 18th month (commencing from July 4, 2022)  
## Sharia-based P2P lending
POJK 10/2022 acknowledges the concept of Sharia-based P2P lending, which is based on the provisions of Islamic law. POJK 10/2022 provides the possibility for a conventional P2P lender to convert to a Sharia-based P2P lender.
Conventional P2P lenders that currently provide Sharia-based services must cease to do so unless they convert into a Sharia-based P2P lender.

# Indonesia’s Omnibus Law Looks to Support the Aviation Industry
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-omnibus-law-looks-to-support-the-aviation-industry)
Indonesia’s Government Regulation 32 of 2021 (GR 32/2021), an implementing regulation of the Omnibus Law, aims to support the recent liberalization of Indonesia’s aviation industry.
In the country’s new **positive investment list**⟨93⟩, domestic air transport is open to a maximum of **49** percent foreign ownership whereas airports and airport supporting services are now open to **100** percent foreign investment.
GR 32/2021 provides a simplified process to obtain aircraft licensing and registration in Indonesia, as well as reduces the minimum number of aircrafts an operator must **own** and **operate/possess**.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-omnibus-law-looks-to-support-the-aviation-industry)Moreover, the Minister of Transport Regulation 81 of 2021, an implementing regulation to GR 32/2021, further describes the required steps and criteria for foreign businesses to obtain licenses in the airport services and airport-related services industries.
## Aircraft licensing and registration in Indonesia
The criteria for aircraft licensing and registration in Indonesia under GR 32/2021 are still in line with the 2009 Aviation Law. The aircraft registration must be submitted by the owner or authorized person with the following requirements:
  1. Having proof of aircraft ownership or control;
  2. Having proof of aircraft insurance;
  3. Showing proof of not being registered in other countries;
  4. The aircraft has met the limit age set by the Minister of Transportation; and
  5. Showing proof of fulfilling the requirements for the procurement of aircraft.


There are some additional technical and/or administrative requirements that have been introduced under GR 32/2021 required to obtain technical certificates.
### Aircraft manufacturer certificate
Entities carrying out production or assembly activities of aircraft must also develop a safety management system guideline, which was not previously required.
### Air operator certificate
Entities must now have a validated air transportation security program to obtain an air operator certificate.
## Minimum aircraft ownership requirement in Indonesia
The government has loosened the minimum ownership limit from five self-owned and five operated (leased) aircraft to one self-owned and two leased aircraft for a scheduled commercial operator. This makes it easier for foreign businesses to begin operating in Indonesia.
The minimum ownership limit for an air cargo operator, a non-scheduled commercial operator, and a scheduled commercial operator can be seen from the following table.
Minimum Aircraft Ownership Requirement in Indonesia  
---  
Owned |  Operates (leased)  
Air cargo operator |  1 |  1  
Non-schedule commercial operator |  1 |  1  
scheduled commercial operator |  1 |  2  
## Business licensing for the airport and airport-related services
MoT 81/2021 divides the business activities for airports into two services:
  * Airport services; and
  * Airport-related services.


Both sectors are now open to 100 percent foreign investors who must first establish a legal Indonesian entity in order to engage. In doing so, businesses must obtain a business identification number, which is now assessed based on the **risk level of the business**⟨94⟩ (risk-based business licensing).
### Airport services in Indonesia
Airport services relate to the providing and/or developing of:
  1. Terminal facilities for passengers, postal, and cargo transportation services;
  2. Facilities for aircraft landing, parking, maneuvering, and storage;
  3. Waste disposal activities, electronics, water, and electricity; and
  4. Buildings and land-related to air transportation activities.


[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-omnibus-law-looks-to-support-the-aviation-industry)The above-mentioned services can only be undertaken by an airport business entity that is legally allowed to commercially operate airports or an airport unit operator that was established by the central or regional government.
The airport business entity refers to an Indonesian legal entity or a state-owned enterprise. Each business type will go through a different procedure to become a commercial airport operator.
For the Indonesian legal entity, they must go through a tender process, where they must adhere to one of the following cooperation schemes for the project:
  * Cooperate with the central government and other business entities; or
  * Cooperate with a state-owned enterprise.


#### Obtaining the airport business entity standard certificate
After winning the tender process, the Indonesian legal entity must next obtain the ‘airport business entity standard certificate’ (_sertifikat Badan Usaha Bandar Udara_), through the Online Single Submission System (OSS).
To acquire the certificate, the legal entity must meet the following requirements:
  * Showcase the company’s financial capability to build and operate an airport.
  * A business plan that contains the company profile, the services to be provided, market analysis, airport management organization, and financial plan.
  * The company must have a minimum authorized capital of 30 percent of total capital expenditure during the concession period, plus the amount to cover 12 months of operational costs.
  * The composition of capital ownership is in line with the prevailing laws and regulations in Indonesia; and
  * The airport personnel and organization are in accordance with the civil aviation safety standards.


### Airport related services in Indonesia
Airport-related services are open to Indonesian legal entities engaging in baggage handling, cargo handling, and ground handling activities.
Businesses will need to obtain additional licenses (the standard certificate of technical service for handling aircraft on the ground) for those services, which is done through the OSS.

# Indonesia’s Omnibus Law: New Provisions on Indonesia’s Trade Sector
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-omnibus-law-new-provisions-on-indonesia-s-trade-sector)
The Indonesian government issued Government Regulation 29 of 2021 (GR 29/2021) in early 2021, an implementing regulation to the Omnibus Law and which makes changes on issues of trade, particularly in areas such as the distribution of goods, exports, and imports, and the activities of foreign investment companies in the retail sector, among others.
The government also introduced several implementing regulations to GR 29/2021, in the form of Ministry of Trade Regulation 24 of 2021 (MOT Reg 24/2021) and Ministry of Trade Regulation 17 of 2021 (MOT Reg 17/2021) which sets out the framework for the distribution of goods and the facilitation of import and export activities.
We discuss the key provisions under these three implementing regulations.
## Provisions on the distribution of goods
### The indirect distribution of goods
GR 29/2021 states that the indirect distribution of goods must be accompanied by some kind of transaction documentation, and can be undertaken through the following types of business actors:
  * A distributor and its network (distributor, retail, and wholesaler);
  * An agent (distributor, retail, and wholesaler); and
  * A franchise.


[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-omnibus-law-new-provisions-on-indonesia-s-trade-sector)Distributors must have a business identification number and a distributor business license in addition to owning or controlling a registered warehouse. If a manufacturer appoints a sole distributor, this appointment is valid for five years and must be extended at least once ( a five-year extension). Under MOT Reg 24/2021 distributors and sole distributors may appoint sub-distributors while agents and sole agents can appoint sub-agents.
### The direct distribution of goods
Companies engaged in the direct distribution of goods also require a business identification number and must meet the following criteria:
  * Holds an exclusive distribution right for the products;
  * Has adopted a code of conduct;
  * Has a marketing plan;
  * Sells directly to consumers via a marketing network approved by the sellers; and
  * Recruits direct sellers.


Manufacturers are prohibited from distributing goods directly to consumers unless these manufacturers are classified as micro and small businesses.
## Export and import
The exportation or importation of goods may only be conducted by exporters and importers that have acquired the necessary licenses. The company’s business identification number doubles up as their import or export license, although they will also need to obtain an exporter registration and/or export approval or an importer registration and/or import approval.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-omnibus-law-new-provisions-on-indonesia-s-trade-sector)The aforementioned licenses are not required if the imported products are not used for business purposes. The Ministry of Trade has now been given the authority to grant ease of business licensing to ‘reputable’ exporters and importers.
The criteria to qualify as a reputable exporter or importer is highlighted under MOT Reg 17/2021, the company must meet the following criteria:
  * Must be a valid taxpayer for the last two years which will be confirmed by the Ministry of Finance;
  * Carry out the export of goods in the last two years in accordance with the line of business;
  * Fulfill the obligation to report on the realization of all exports that have been undertaken for every commodity; and
  * Have never been subject to administrative or criminal sanctions.


## Warehousing
A warehouse must have a warehouse registration number issued by the governor, mayor, or regent where the warehouse is located. The owner of the warehouse must record the name, type, origin, and purpose, etc of the goods stored in the warehouse, although this is not necessary for a warehouse that is used temporarily by a logistics company.
## Foreign investment companies in the retail sector
Previously, foreign investment restrictions applied to the retail industry, with particular restrictions imposed on department stores and self-service stores. Supermarkets with floor space below 1,200sqm and department stores with floor space of between 400 sqm and 2,000 sqm were capped at 67 percent foreign ownership.
These conditions are no longer being retained but certain conditions such as that the minimum area of a department store must be 400 sqm are being retained. Moreover, grocery stores in the form of department stores are open to foreign investment if they are located in a shopping center. The ownership of department stores that are not located in or integrated with shopping centers is limited to local companies.
## The use of Bahasa Indonesia for labeling
All products sold in the domestic market must use the Indonesian language. The exemption from the use of labels in Indonesian is for goods produced by micro and small enterprises or for bulk goods that are traded directly to consumers.
The label must show information regarding the origins of the goods, and the name and address of the company/entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs that utilize a third-party packaging service must include the information of the packaging service’s name and address on their goods.

# Indonesia’s New Provisions for the Construction Sector Under Omnibus Law
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-new-provisions-for-the-construction-sector-under-omnibus-law)
Government Regulation 14 of 2021 (GR 14/2021) revises several provisions of Indonesia’s Construction Law of 2007.
These changes include simplifying the business licensing process, the obligation of technology transfer by qualified foreign construction workers, and the requirements for employers and contractors to meet the new security, safety, and health and sustainability standards set under GR 14/2021.
According to 
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-new-provisions-for-the-construction-sector-under-omnibus-law)In Indonesia’s 2022 budget, over 380 trillion rupiah (US$26 billion) is allocated for infrastructure, which will include the construction of six new airports, over 6,000km of rail tracks, expanding the gas network for houses, and over 100,000 hectares of the irrigation network, among others.
## What are the changes under GR 14/2021?
### Construction business and worker registration
Construction businesses in Indonesia must now register their project experience with the central government through the Construction Services Development Agency (_Lembaga Pengembangan Jasa Konstruksi_ – LPJK).
The LPJK is responsible for the accreditation and registration of construction service providers.
The information provided to the LPJK must include:
  * The project name;
  * The name of the employer;
  * Annual performance of the contractor;
  * The value of the project;
  * The duration and year of the undertaken project;
  * The name and portion of the capital distribution under a joint operation (if conducted); and
  * The minutes of the handover of the project.


Further, every local construction worker must also register their professional experience with the LPJK, which includes:
  * The name of the employer;
  * The duration and year of the work; and
  * The type of service provided.


#### The classification of construction workers
GR 14/2021 classifies construction workers based on the scientific field related to construction services. These include:
  * Architecture;
  * Civil works;
  * Mechanical works;
  * Environmental governance;
  * Urban and regional planning;
  * Technical engineering;
  * Management implementation; or
  * Interior design, and landscape architecture.


### Compliance requirements for hiring foreign construction workers Indonesia
According to GR 14/2021, foreign construction workers are those with ‘expert qualifications’ and there are only certain positions they can occupy as regulated under Indonesia’s manpower laws. The worker must go through a competency test followed by registration under the Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing and the LPJK.
Employers of foreign construction workers are required to have a foreign worker recruitment plan, as regulated under the manpower laws.
#### Technology transfer
Foreign construction workers are obligated to carry out the transfer of knowledge to Indonesian workers. The transfer can be conducted by:
  1. The preparation of a profile for the use, development, and utilization of the technology in Indonesian and English;
  2. Providing management and skills training for Indonesian understudies at least once for each project; and
  3. Facilitating Indonesian workers to obtain training, practical work, and/or possible academic research in the projects the business is undertaking.


A clause on technology transfer must be included in the foreign worker’s employment contract.
## Business licensing
Construction companies are now only required to obtain a business identification number and a construction company certificate (_Sertifikat Badan Usaha_ – “SBU”) to operate.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-new-provisions-for-the-construction-sector-under-omnibus-law)The SBU is issued by the Service Business Entity Certification Agency (_Lembaga Sertifikasi Badan Usaha Jasa Konstruksi_ - LSBU), which is an agency that carries out certification activities of businesses and is licensed by the LPJK.
## Provisions for joint operations by contractors
A construction company can conduct a joint operation on the condition that the joint operation is between:
  * A contractor that is qualified as a ‘large-scale contractor’ and another contractor also qualified as a large-scale contractor;
  * A contractor qualified as a ‘medium-scale contractor’ and another contractor also qualified as a medium-scale contractor;
  * A contractor that is qualified as a large-scale contractor and a contractor qualified as a medium-scale contractor;
  * A contractor qualified as a ‘medium-scale contractor’ and a contractor also qualified as a ‘small-scale contractor’; or
  * A contractor qualified as a small-scale contractor and a contractor also qualified as a small-scale contractor.


The joint operation must clearly state the rights, responsibilities, and obligations in a written agreement between the cooperating businesses.
Further, one of the members of the joint operation must be appointed as the ‘lead firm’. As the leader of the joint operation, the company must fulfill the following requirements:
  * Must hold majority capital, up to 70 percent; and
  * Its qualification level must be the same or higher than that of the other member(s) of the joint operation.


### Is there a maximum number of members in a joint operation?
The maximum number of members in a joint operation is:
  1. Up to three companies in one joint operation, undertaking a project that is not complex in nature; or
  2. Up to five companies in one joint operation, undertaking a project that is complex in nature.


### What entities may not undertake a joint operation?
A contractor qualified as a large-scale contractor may not undertake a joint operation with a small-scale contractor.
## Sustainable construction
GR 14/2021 sets out the basic principles for sustainable construction:
  1. Be economically feasible and can improve community welfare;
  2. The mitigation of health and safety, climate change, and natural disaster risks;
  3. The use of recycled resources;
  4. The reduction of waste generation, both physical and non-physical;
  5. Maintain environmental conservation through conservation efforts; and
  6. Reduce social disparities.

# Indonesia’s Textile and Garment Industry: Opportunities for Foreign Investors
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-textile-and-garment-industry-opportunities-for-foreign-investors)
  * _Indonesia’s textile and garment industry presents new growth opportunities for foreign investors._
  * _The country’s textile and garment exports were valued at US$13.8 billion in 2019, and the government is aiming to propel this industry into the top five largest in the world._
  * _To achieve this, the sector needs investments in new technology and machinery as well as human capital development._
  * _Foreign investors that can facilitate this transformation can take advantage in establishing new export markets and increasing the competitiveness of Indonesian textile products._


Indonesia’s textile and garment industry enjoyed positive growth throughout 2019 with exports valued at US$13.8 billion, an increase from US$10 billion in 2018 and making the country one of the largest textile producers in the world.
Despite this upward trajectory, the industry has been severely impacted by the COVID-19⟨93⟩ outbreak. Vietnam, although also affected by the trade war, still recorded some US$35 billion in textile exports in 2019.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-textile-and-garment-industry-opportunities-for-foreign-investors)Currently, 30 percent of Indonesia’s total production is to meet domestic demand with the remainder for exports to mainly the US (36 percent), Middle East (23 percent), EU (13 percent), and China (5 percent). These are dominated by large manufacturers producing for global apparel brands. Before the onset of the virus, the Indonesian Textile Association (API) stated that the country’s textile and garment industry is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5 percent.
The government, through its Industry 4.0 Masterplan, aims to propel the country into the top five largest textile producers in the world by 2030. This presents unique opportunities for foreign investors to enter and assist in this revitalization program, in particular, supply expertise on sophisticated production techniques.
## **Constraints remain**
Internal constraints still plague Indonesia’s textile industry and have hindered its export potential. Electricity and gas prices are high compared to other textile producing countries, which has reduced Indonesia’s competitivity in the international market.
Labor costs have also increased annually; the minimum wage⟨94⟩ in Indonesia has been increased by 8.5 percent for 2020. The country’s minimum wage is also fixed based on the sector. ‘Leading sectors or industries’ in a province, like textiles and garment manufacturing, can determine their own minimum wage rate, also known as UMSP. The UMSP must be higher than the provincial minimum wage (usually by 5 percent and above).
Another issue has been ageing machinery, which results in overall lower productivity and efficiency for the country. This undermines one of the sector’s key strengths – the presence of both an upstream and downstream industry – although only the largest players can afford to invest in new plants and machinery to complement these operations.
Furthermore, increasing regional integration has resulted in an influx of cheaper textile products into Indonesia (legal and illegally), especially from China, which has placed pressure on smaller domestic manufacturers. For many smaller, local companies, turning to the production of ‘Batik’ has been a way to distinguish themselves, but this is a very niche market in the global textile industry.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-textile-and-garment-industry-opportunities-for-foreign-investors)Batik is a centuries-old technique of using wax and dye to decorate cloth and garments developed in Indonesia. The artform has been designated as an Indonesian cultural contribution to the world by UNESCO, with many manufacturers still utilizing hand-drawn designs. An increasing number of manufacturers are moving away from the manual technique and using modern machinery to produce printed Batik.
External constraints include the depreciating Rupiah, which has increased production costs. This is because raw materials, such as cotton, are bought with US dollars from the US, Brazil, and Australia – amounting between US$300 to US$600 million per year – and impacting the profitability of companies that cater to the domestic market. Larger companies with the capacity to export their products are benefiting from the stronger dollar as it increases their revenues.
## **Opportunities for foreign investors and industry diversification**
Despite the aforementioned challenges, the overhaul of this lucrative industry requires local companies to access much-needed funding.
Foreign investors with the expertise to facilitate more value-added production techniques are in high demand. Further, as international competition becomes fiercer, textile companies that lack the capital to compete could be takeover targets through partnerships, joint ventures, and private equity investment.
The Indonesian government is looking to enhance its support for the textile industry. The current administration has improved the country’s logistics by building new highways and ports. It is also curbing the import of illegal textiles and tightening import rules for textiles and textile products.
More vocational institutions catering to the sector are being developed in cooperation with local companies, aiming to produce skilled human capital who can use the latest technology in production, such as 3D printing.
Industry players must also diversify their export market – considering that its biggest market, the US, could impose tariffs on a variety of Indonesian products, including textiles at any time.
New potential international markets could include Australia – both countries ratified the IA-CEPA trade agreement⟨95⟩ in February 2020 – as well as New Zealand, South Korea, and Japan.
Additionally, Indonesia’s Muslim fashionwear is finding an increasing market in the Middle East and North Africa as the region now represents more than half of the country’s overseas missions and trade negotiations.

# Indonesia’s Top Sectors to Watch 
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-top-sectors-to-watch-for-in-2023)
**_Foreign investors should note the key sectors where growth is expected to rise in Indonesia for 2023._**
**_Here are the top sectors to watch for, including downstream mining, healthcare, and infrastructure._**
* * *
Indonesia’s central bank, Bank Indonesia, predicts that the country’s economy is expected to grow at between 4.5-5.3 percent in 2023 – one of the highest among G20 members – and will be supported by several important sectors, including commodities, infrastructure development, tourism, and manufacturing of high-value products, such as electric vehicle batteries.
GDP had accelerated to 5.31 percent in 2022, bringing Southeast Asia’s largest economy back to pre-pandemic growth. The pace of growth in 2022 was largely supported by Indonesia’s large domestic consumption and further bolstered by the export of commodities as global prices of key shipments, such as coal, palm oil, and iron, rallied upwards.
As such, **Indonesia saw a breakthrough year in 2022 and recorded some US$43 billion in FDI⟨93⟩** , the highest in the country's history.
The highest priority for the Indonesian government for 2023 will be to hold inflation at three percent. Further, weakening global economic activity and a slowdown in commodity prices could impact GDP this year. However, external demand for commodities and pent-up domestic consumption will continue to be the backbone of growth in 2023.
## Downstream mining
As Southeast Asia’s largest economy, Indonesia has enjoyed an exports boom on the back of rising commodity prices caused by the Russian-Ukraine conflict. As such, Indonesia’s commodity exports will continue to be a backbone to the economy in 2023.
In 2014, the Indonesia government began banning the export of raw mineral ores to encourage foreign investments in the downstream mining sector and development of local smelters besides boosting exports of higher-value processed commodities as well as increasing government revenue. For 2023, the country is set to expand the raw mineral export ban to include **bauxite**⟨94⟩.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-top-sectors-to-watch-for-in-2023)
Indonesia has a large and unprospected variety of mineral deposits and is the world’s biggest exporter of tin, palm oil, and thermal coal, as well as a major exporter of nickel, copper, bauxite, rubber, manganese, zinc, and lead, among other resources. Mining roughly accounts for over one-tenth of Indonesia’s GDP and has been integral to its economic growth.
The country is also home to the Grasberg mine – one of the biggest gold mines, and third-largest copper mine in the world – which is estimated to have 275 billion ounces of copper and 14.2 million troy ounces of gold reserves.
### Nickel
Indonesia announced a ban on the export of nickel ores in 2019 and introduced a requirement for nickel miners to process or purify raw nickel in Indonesia before export. The country is home to the world’s largest nickel reserves and its ban caused major shifts in the supply chains of electric vehicle makers and stainless-steel producers. Nickel is a major component of EV batteries and of stainless-steel.
Indonesia’s exports of processed nickel have soared from US$1 billion in 2015 to US$30 billion in 2022 with the country expected to account for half the global production increase in nickel up to 2025.
The ban on nickel ores prompted the European Union to launch a complaint to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2019 who argued that Indonesia’s ban was unfairly harming the EU’s stainless-steel industry. In November 2022, the WTO ruled in favor of the EU, citing that Jakarta’s ban was not in line with global trade rules. Indonesia has appealed the ruling.
The WTO ruling poses a direct challenge to Indonesia’s desire to ensure its mineral raw materials are processed domestically. The government has not announced its next strategy if it loses the appeal, but has not ruled out implementing a heavy tax on nickel raw exports as one initiative.
#### Electric vehicle batteries supply chain
Indonesia’s nickel reserves are making the country indispensable to the global EV industry with the country aiming to be a global EV hub. Global EV makers, which include US’s Tesla and China’s BYD, are said to be finalizing deals to invest in Indonesia, according to the country’s Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment, Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan. Indonesia aims to be one of the top three producers of EV batteries in the world by 2027.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-top-sectors-to-watch-for-in-2023)
Moreover, to complement its nickel-based battery industry, the country is also developing lithium refineries and anode material production facilities.
With its 278 million population, Indonesia also presents **opportunities for the sale of EV vehicles**⟨95⟩ ranging from motorbikes to cars. Formidable challenges and opportunities for investors include consumer affordability and the lack of public charging infrastructure. The government has an ambitious target of having 2.5 million EV users by 2025.
### Coal 
Indonesia is the world’s third-largest exporter of coal after China and India and the world’s biggest thermal coal exporter. Indonesia produced 687 million tons of coal in 2022 of which 494 million tons was exported and the remainder for domestic use. Coal exports earn the country roughly US$3 billion per month with China, India, South Korea, and Japan accounting for 70 percent of exports. Vietnam and the Philippines are growing export markets for Indonesian coal.
The government left the thermal coal market in a volatile state in January 2022 when it issued an export ban to meet domestic demand. The ban displaced an estimated four percent of the global seaborne supply or 36 million tons of coal.
For 2023, the country is targeting a record 518 million tons of exports and production at 695 million tons.
As with other commodities, the government is eager to develop Indonesia’s downstream coal industry, specifically surrounding the below seven subsectors:
  1. Coal liquefaction;
  2. Coal quality enhancement;
  3. Coal gasification;
  4. Coke manufacturing;
  5. Underground coal gasification;
  6. Briquette manufacturing;
  7. Coal-water mixture production.


This strategy will need immense foreign investment, particularly in infrastructure and technology.
## Infrastructure
Infrastructure development has been the cornerstone of President Joko Widodo’s government for most of the past decade. During eight years of his tenure, his government has built 1,700km of highway, over 4,000km of non-highway roads, 30 reservoirs, 18 ports, and 21 airports, with most developed outside the island of Java. To take this into perspective, Indonesia had only 780km of highway for the past 40 years.
Between 2019 and 2024, Indonesia requires over US$400 billion for **infrastructure investments.**⟨96⟩ Specifically for 2023, the government has set aside US$25 billion in the national budget for infrastructure.
As such, Indonesia is pushing for private involvement in its infrastructure development through private-public partnership (PPP) initiatives. There are also opportunities for small and large-scale energy and infrastructure projects in Indonesia’s eastern regions, which is lacking the most in connectivity and is seeing increased focused from the government (Java currently constitutes 60 percent of total GDP and 60 percent of the population).
## Healthcare and pharmaceuticals
Given its large market size, Indonesia’s healthcare sector presents a lucrative opportunity for foreign investors.

The government’s annual spending on healthcare has skyrocketed since the implementation of the universal healthcare program (BPJS) in 2014, which has now grown to be the world’s largest, covering some 240 million people. Every citizen and expatriate are mandated to join, and companies must register their employees to the program, paying a percentage of the premiums.
Increasing spending on healthcare will impact important sub-sectors, such as the medical devices industry, which was valued at US$4.5 billion in 2019. The majority of this, US$2.8 billion, was from imports. Indonesia mainly imports sophisticated medical instruments, such as PET-CT scanners and ICU equipment, and exports low-tech equipment, such as gloves and syringes.
The pharmaceutical industry is dominated by generic drugs (70 percent) with the remainder from over the counter (OTC) drugs. The BPJS program has boosted sales of generic drugs in the country, valued at more than US$700 million.
## Tourism
Indonesia has set an ambitious target of up to 7.4 million tourists for 2023, generating some US$5 billion for the country. This is still not at the pre-pandemic levels of 16 million foreign visitors.

However, the sector will have its challenges in 2023.
Despite all countries lifting their COVID-19 travel policies, the threat of a global recession, high air fares, and inflation are impacting consumer spending behavior.
The country’s tourism ministry has opened the sector to foreign investment for developing sustainable-based tourism projects, five priority tourist destinations, and eight **special economic zones**⟨99⟩ catered to tourism. The ministry also highlighted that these opportunities were valued at US$1.5 billion in total and would create 1.5 million new jobs.

Indonesia offers investors low wage costs, an increasingly attractive investment climate, a huge domestic market, and access to other ASEAN markets.

Further, Indonesia’s central bank, Bank Indonesia, predicts that the country’s economy is expected to grow at between 4.5-5.3 percent in 2023 – one of the highest among G20 members – and will be supported by several important sectors, including commodities, infrastructure development, tourism, and manufacturing of high-value products, such as electric vehicle batteries.

This article features major opportunities within Indonesian industries for foreign investment in the following sections. 
## Top Sectors to Watch for in Indonesia
### Downstream mining
As Southeast Asia’s largest economy, Indonesia has enjoyed an exports boom on the back of rising commodity prices caused by the Russian-Ukraine conflict. As such, Indonesia’s commodity exports will continue to be a backbone to the economy in 2023.
In 2014, the Indonesia government began banning the export of raw mineral ores to encourage foreign investments in the downstream mining sector and development of local smelters besides boosting exports of higher-value processed commodities as well as increasing government revenue. For 2023, the country is set to expand the raw mineral export ban to include **bauxite**⟨93⟩.
Indonesia has a large and unprospected variety of mineral deposits and is the world’s biggest exporter of tin, palm oil, and thermal coal, as well as a major exporter of nickel, copper, bauxite, rubber, manganese, zinc, and lead, among other resources. Mining roughly accounts for over one-tenth of Indonesia’s GDP and has been integral to its economic growth.
The country is also home to the Grasberg mine – one of the biggest gold mines, and third-largest copper mine in the world – which is estimated to have 275 billion ounces of copper and 14.2 million troy ounces of gold reserves.
### Electric vehicle batteries supply chain
Indonesia’s nickel reserves are making the country indispensable to the global EV industry with the country aiming to be a global EV hub. Global electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, including Tesla from the United States (still under discussion) and BYD from China (finalizing Memorandums of Understanding), are considering investments in Indonesia. Indonesia aims to be one of the top three producers of EV batteries in the world by 2027.
Moreover, to complement its nickel-based battery industry, the country is also developing lithium refineries and anode material production facilities.
With its 278 million population, Indonesia also presents **opportunities for the sale of EV vehicles**⟨94⟩ ranging from motorbikes to cars. Formidable challenges and opportunities for investors include consumer affordability and the lack of public charging infrastructure. The government has an ambitious target of having 2.5 million EV users by 2025.
### Coal 
Indonesia is the world’s third-largest exporter of coal after China and India and the world’s biggest thermal coal exporter. Indonesia produced 687 million tons of coal in 2022 of which 494 million tons was exported and the remainder for domestic use. Coal exports earn the country roughly US$3 billion per month with China, India, South Korea, and Japan accounting for 70 percent of exports. Vietnam and the Philippines are growing export markets for Indonesian coal.
The government left the thermal coal market in a volatile state in January 2022 when it issued an export ban to meet domestic demand. The ban displaced an estimated four percent of the global seaborne supply or 36 million tons of coal.
For 2023, the country is targeting a record 518 million tons of exports and production at 695 million tons.
As with other commodities, the government is eager to develop Indonesia’s downstream coal industry, specifically surrounding the below seven subsectors:
  * Coal liquefaction;
  * Coal quality enhancement;
  * Coal gasification;
  * Coke manufacturing;
  * Underground coal gasification;
  * Briquette manufacturing;
  * Coal-water mixture production.


This strategy will need immense foreign investment, particularly in infrastructure and technology.
### Infrastructure
Infrastructure development has been the cornerstone of President Joko Widodo’s government for most of the past decade. During eight years of his tenure, his government has built 1,700km of highway, over 4,000km of non-highway roads, 30 reservoirs, 18 ports, and 21 airports, with most developed outside the island of Java. To take this into perspective, Indonesia had only 780km of highway for the past 40 years.
Between 2019 and 2024, Indonesia requires over US$400 billion for **infrastructure investments.**⟨95⟩ Specifically for 2023, the government has set aside US$25 billion in the national budget for infrastructure.
As such, Indonesia is pushing for private involvement in its infrastructure development through private-public partnership (PPP) initiatives. There are also opportunities for small and large-scale energy and infrastructure projects in Indonesia’s eastern regions, which is lacking the most in connectivity and is seeing increased focused from the government (Java currently constitutes 60 percent of total GDP and 60 percent of the population).
### Healthcare and pharmaceuticals
Given its large market size, Indonesia’s healthcare sector presents a lucrative opportunity for foreign investors.
The government’s annual spending on healthcare has skyrocketed since the implementation of the universal healthcare program (BPJS) in 2014, which has now grown to be the world’s largest, covering some 248 million people. Every citizen and expatriate, living In the country for more than 6 months, are mandated to join. Companies must also register their employees to the program, paying a percentage of the premiums.
Increasing spending on healthcare will impact important sub-sectors, such as the medical devices industry, which was valued at US$4.5 billion in 2019. The majority of this, US$2.8 billion, was from imports. Indonesia mainly imports sophisticated medical instruments, such as PET-CT scanners and ICU equipment, and exports low-tech equipment, such as gloves and syringes.
The pharmaceutical industry is dominated by generic drugs (70 percent) with the remainder from over the counter (OTC) drugs. The BPJS program has boosted sales of generic drugs in the country, valued at more than US$700 million.
### Tourism
Indonesia has set an ambitious target of up to 7.4 million tourists for 2023, generating some US$5 billion for the country. This is still not at the pre-pandemic levels of 16 million foreign visitors.
The country’s tourism ministry has opened the sector to foreign investment for developing sustainable-based tourism projects, five priority tourist destinations, and nine **special economic zones**⟨96⟩ catered to tourism. The ministry also highlighted that these opportunities were valued at US$1.5 billion in total and would create 1.5 million new jobs.

# How American Fast-Food Chains Have Succeeded in Indonesia
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/how-american-fast-food-chains-have-succeeded-in-indonesia)
**_American fast-food giants have grown into the Indonesian market by using culturally appropriate programs and tailoring their foods to engage and suit the tastes of the local population._**
* * *
American fast-food chains have spread far beyond the borders of the United States. While not universally loved, these enterprises have become a common feature of high streets, shopping malls, and transport terminals around the world.
Indonesia is one such place. McDonald’s and KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken) – arguably the two best-known fast-food chains globally – have become an increasingly present feature in the world's largest archipelagic state.
As of September 2020, KFC 
Moreover, Indonesia’s growing population, particularly among its middle-class, and high rate of urbanization have led to changing dietary patterns such as increasing demand for wheat-based products like cereals, **red meat⟨93⟩** , as well as fast food. More Indonesians are also choosing to eat prepared food and beverages, especially with the boom of 
## The growth of the global fast-food industry
Fast-food chains grew exponentially in the years following World War II when the US experienced its steadiest economic growth. The American economy 
During this period, Americans grew wealthier and this, combined with an increasing desire for convenience, particularly around food, 
The international growth of these chains has been equally phenomenal. McDonald’s and KFC are the world’s largest and second-largest restaurant chains respectively. McDonald's locations 
Both companies operate franchise models, meaning individuals or businesses apply to operate under the brands’ umbrella and deliver services in accordance with their standards. However, it is worth noting that not all restaurants are franchisees. In Indonesia, PT Fast Food Indonesia Tbk is the only 
## How American fast-food chains took off in Indonesia
US fast-food chains have been successful in molding their offerings to suit their customers in different countries. This reflects their realization that cultural and economic considerations overlap when operating outside of the US or North American markets. For example, in parts of the Middle East, McDonald's hamburger bun is 
This cultural awareness is reflected in how McDonald’s operates in European markets as well. In Germany, Belgium, Austria, and France, McDonald’s customers can purchase a beer or wine to go with their meals. In France, customers can also select from six flavors of macaron, while in Switzerland, diners can add Toblerone to their McFlurry. McDonald’s even 
In Indonesia, both KFC and McDonald’s have 
These hybrid or localized menus serve to achieve cultural and economic interests simultaneously. McDonald’s started these practices in the 1980s, according to a 
McDonald’s in Indonesia now 
Within the month of Ramadan, in which Muslims observe fasting during daylight hours, KFC offers Paket Dug Dug – a cheap meal package of chicken drumsticks. The name of the product resembles the sound of the bedug – a large drum used to summon people to prayer or to signal the end of fasting at sunset. 
KFC has also been 
In addition, all western fast-food chains are **Halal-certified in Indonesia⟨94⟩** and the likes of McDonald’s, KFC, and Pizza Hut, among others, benefit from having a first mover advantage. These brands have also developed significant Halal supply chains in the country. Indonesia’s domestic spending on Halal products and services stood at US$186 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach US$281 billion by 2025.
International brands or just larger organizations, such as KFC and McDonald’s, have likely also benefited from the perception that chain restaurants provide a standardized quality or service across their locations. For example, the quality of a McDonald’s burger is likely to be similar throughout its restaurants. This can be a particularly powerful marketing tool, especially in countries where quality can vary considerably between local restaurants due to factors like the availability of ingredients from week to week.
## A winning strategy in Indonesia
With its domestic consumption-driven economy, a fast-growing middle class, and the world’s fourth-biggest population, Indonesia is considered an important market by global consumer goods companies.
But KFC and other global brands also must compete with local companies. Local companies have low marketing costs and no royalty payments to the brand owner, unlike franchise holders. And while KFC runs costly TV and billboard advertisements, local brands use much cheaper promotional channels, such as social media, and benefit from word-of-mouth.
Indonesia also hosts restaurants and cafes from companies like Starbucks, Domino’s Pizza, and Burger King – the latter is already a major player. But these newer entries to the market will be well served if they follow the example set by market leaders, McDonald’s and KFC. The latter has successfully channeled interest in the American fast-food segment while combining it with cultural associations that have served to enhance their brand image in Indonesia.
## Practical insights for F&B businesses in Indonesia
As noted by Humaniora (
Further, these fast-food giants are already replicating their strategy elsewhere around the world, creating greater affinity with their customers by adopting local recipes and practices where possible.
As such, culturally appropriate strategies may be best implemented when the host culture differs considerably from that of the company entering the market. These strategies are perhaps more applicable to the service industry, such as restaurants and hotels than other retail services, but nevertheless underline that when dealing with consumers, one size does not fit all.

# Indonesia’s Positive Investment List: Sectors Open and Restricted to Foreign Businesses
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-positive-investment-list-sectors-open-and-restricted-to-foreign-businesses)
**_Indonesia's Positive Investment List allows foreign investment in over 200 business sectors, including transportation, energy, and telecommunication. Foreign investors can fully own a business in these sectors unless subject to specific limitations. The positive investment list classifies business fields into four categories, which are priority sectors, business fields with specific requirements, business fields open to large enterprises with compulsory partnerships, and business fields fully open to foreign investment. There are fiscal and non-fiscal incentives available for priority sectors. Investors seeking to expand their operations in Southeast Asia can scrutinize the sectoral requirements listed below._**
* * *
Presidential Regulation 10 of 2021 as amended to President Regulation No. 49 of 2021 (PR 49/2021) liberalizes many business sectors for foreign investment. Dubbed the positive investment list, PR 49/2021 liberalizes over 200 business lines, including transportation, energy, and telecommunication.
The general principle under the positive investment list is that a business sector is open to 100 percent foreign investment unless it is subjected to a specific limitation. The regulation presents one of Indonesia's greatest liberalizations in foreign ownership limitations since the negative investment list was first introduced in the 1980s.
## The design of Indonesia's positive investment list
The government has classified business fields into four categories.
  1. Priority sectors;
  2. Business fields that stipulate specific requirements or limitations;
  3. Businesses fields open to large enterprises, including foreign investors, but are subject to a compulsory partnership with cooperatives and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs); and
  4. Business fields that are fully open to foreign investment.


### Priority sectors
To classify as a priority sector, business enterprises must meet the following criteria:
  * Must be labor intensive;
  * Must be capital intensive;
  * Must be part of a national project/program;
  * Must be export-oriented;
  * Must involve a pioneer industry (renewables, oil refining, metals, etc.);
  * Must utilize advanced technologies; and
  * Must implement research and development activities.


[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/indonesia-s-positive-investment-list-sectors-open-and-restricted-to-foreign-businesses)
There are 246 business fields under this category of the positive investment list. Moreover, businesses in priority sectors are eligible for a range of fiscal and non-fiscal incentives.
Fiscal incentives include a 50 percent corporate income tax reduction for investments between 100 billion rupiah (US$6.9 million) and 500 billion rupiah (US$34.9 million) for five years and 100 CIT reduction for investments over 500 billion rupiah (US$34.9 million) for a period between five and 20 years. In addition, tax allowances are available in the form of a reduction in the taxable income of 30 percent of the total investment for six years, a special withholding tax rate on dividends of 10 percent, and tax losses carried forward for up to 10 years.
Examples of non-fiscal incentives are the provision of supporting infrastructure, simplified business licensing procedures, and the guaranteed energy supply and raw materials. We explore a few examples of the prioritized business lines and their incentives below.
**Examples of Priority Business Sectors and their Incentives**  
---  
**Business line** |  **Incentive type**  
Textile and garment industry |  Tax allowance and investment allowance  
Pharmaceutical industry |  Tax allowance  
Digital economy (hosting, data processing etc.) |  Tax holiday

Cooking palm oil industry |  Tax allowance  
Iron and steel industry |  Tax allowance  
Automotive industry |  Tax allowance  
Oil and gas refinery |  Tax holiday  
Cosmetics industry |  Tax allowance  
Coal gasification |  Tax allowance  
### Business fields that stipulate specific requirements or limitations
Under this category, business fields are open to foreign investments but are subject to the following types of restrictions:
  * Lines of business reserved for domestic investors;
  * Lines of business subject to foreign ownership limitations;
  * Lines of business that require special licenses; and
  * Other investment requirements, namely business lines that are restricted and strictly supervised as well as regulated in separate laws and regulations in the field of alcoholic beverage control and supervision. 
    * The business lines include: 
      * Wholesale trade of alcoholic beverages (importers, distributors, and sub-distributors);
      * Retail trade of alcoholic beverages; and
      * The street retail of alcoholic Beverages.

**Business Fields with Specific Requirements**

**Business fields** |  **Requirements**  
Publishing of newspapers, magazines (press) |  100 percent domestic capital required for **establishment** , and up to 49 percent foreign capital ownership for business development and expansion

# New Regulation Opens Up Foreign Investment Opportunities in Indonesia’s Hospital Sector
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/new-regulation-opens-up-foreign-investment-opportunities-in-indonesia-s-hospital-sector)
**_Indonesia’s hospital sector is now open to 100 percent foreign investment thanks to the Omnibus Law. Its implementing regulation GR 47/2021 reduces the number of beds for hospitals owned by foreign direct ownership._**
**_Indonesia’s healthcare industry is expected to see continued growth as the expansion of the country’s middle-class and universal healthcare drive demand. The country has the world’s largest universal healthcare program, covering over 200 million people._**
Foreign investors seeking to do business in Indonesia's hospital sector should note new provisions released via Government Regulation 47 of 2021 (GR 47/2021) under the Omnibus Law.
GR 47/2021 reduces the number of beds for hospitals owned by foreign direct ownership and mandates all hospitals to provide support services, such as laboratory services, blood services, and nutrition services.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/new-regulation-opens-up-foreign-investment-opportunities-in-indonesia-s-hospital-sector)Due to a lack of infrastructure and funding in Indonesia’s healthcare system, many Indonesians travel abroad for medical treatment, especially to Singapore and Malaysia. The total direct and indirect costs associated with this outbound medical tourism are estimated at over 
However, with the onset of the pandemic and subsequent travel restrictions, Indonesians have been forced to turn to local hospitals and thus the government has sought to improve the regulatory landscape to attract more investment to improve the industry’s outlook and service potential.
## The liberalization of Indonesia’s hospital sector
Under the Omnibus Law, Indonesia has **liberalized**⟨93⟩ several sectors of its economy, including certain subsectors of the healthcare industry. Hospitals are now open to 100 percent foreign investment, from the previous 67 percent for non-ASEAN investors. ASEAN investors were allowed up to 75 percent ownership.
Further, the Omnibus Law has simplified the business licensing process through the introduction of a **risk-based business licensing system**⟨94⟩**.** Under this system, business activities are assessed based on the scale of the hazards they can potentially create (low risk, medium-low-risk, medium-high-risk, and high-risk business).
Hospitals are classified as high-risk businesses and so will require a registration number (_Nomor Induk Berusaha_ – NIB), and a license. The license will be issued once the business has fulfilled certain conditions and verifications set out by the central or regional government.
Main clinics (those that offer specialized healthcare) are also open to 100 percent foreign investment, whereas _pratama_ clinics (those that offer only basic healthcare services) are closed to foreign investors and are reserved for local small and medium-sized enterprises.
## The classification of private hospitals in Indonesia
GR 47/2021 retains the classification criteria under the previous regime whereby hospitals are categorized into two categories:
  * General hospitals – provide services in all areas and types of diseases; and
  * Specialist hospitals – provide primary services for one particular type of disease or other specialties.


General hospitals are classified into Class A, B, C, and D, whereas specialist hospitals are classified into Class A, B, and C.
These classifications are related to the number of inpatient beds allocated at each private hospital class, as illustrated below.
Hospital Classification in Indonesia  
---  
Hospital classification |  Number of inpatient beds  
Class A |  Class B |  Class C |  Class D  
General hospitals |  Min. 250 |  Min. 200 |  Min. 100 |  Min. 50  
Specialist hospitals |  Min. 100 |  Min. 75 |  Min. 25 |  -  
### Relaxation on the required number of inpatient beds for foreign-owned hospitals
Foreign-owned general hospitals must meet the obligations for either a Class A (min. 250 beds) or Class B (min. 200 beds) classification to provide at least 200 beds while the inpatient bed requirements for foreign-owned specialist hospitals have been reduced to least 100 beds.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/new-regulation-opens-up-foreign-investment-opportunities-in-indonesia-s-hospital-sector)However, this does not apply to dental hospitals, specialist eye hospitals, ear, nose, and throat hospitals, and head and neck surgery hospitals.
Private hospitals must comply with the following room requirements:
  1. 40 percent of the total beds are allocated for in-patient ‘standard class’ rooms for members of the national health insurance program;
  2. 10 percent of total beds are allocated for intensive care units; and
  3. 10 percent of the total beds are allocated for isolation wards which can be increased to 20 percent in the case of a public health emergency such as an outbreak.


For public hospitals:
  1. 60 percent of the total beds are allocated for in-patient ‘standard class’ rooms for members of the national health insurance program;
  2. Six percent of the total beds are allocated for intensive care units; and
  3. 10 percent of the total beds are allocated for isolation wards which can be increased to 20 percent in the case of a public health emergency such as an outbreak.


The government has given hospitals in Indonesia until January 1, 2023, to comply with the minimum number of inpatient standard rooms.
## New obligations imposed on hospitals in Indonesia
GR 47/2021 has imposed new obligations on hospitals in Indonesia:
  * Hospitals must provide accurate information about the services they provide;
  * Hospitals must provide safe, excellent, anti-discriminatory services;
  * Maintain medical records;
  * Provide emergency services to patients in accordance with their service capabilities;
  * Provide services to the underprivileged and the poor;
  * Hospitals must provide health services during disasters in accordance with their service capabilities;
  * Implement a referral system;
  * Provide correct, honest, and clear information regarding the rights and obligations of the patient;
  * To have and develop an accident and disaster management system;
  * Implement hospital ethics;
  * Protech and provide legal assistance for all hospital staff;
  * Implement government regulations in the health sector;
  * Prepare and implement internal hospital regulations; and
  * Enforce regulations to ensure the hospital environment is a smoke-free area.


## Additional supporting services provided by hospitals in Indonesia
Both general and specialist hospitals are obligated to provide additional support services. These supporting services are those provided by medical and non-medical staff.
Additional Supporting Services Provided by Hospitals in Indonesia  
---  
Medical staff |  Non-medical staff  
Laboratory services |  Hospital management  
Medical record services |  Information and communication  
Blood services |  Maintenance facilities and medical devices  
Nutrition services |  Laundry/cleaning services  
Centralized sterilization services |  Corpse handling  
Other supporting services  
## Sanctions
Hospitals that fail to adhere to the obligations set under GR 47/2021 will be issued sanctions in the form of a written warning, an administrative fine of up to 100 million rupiah (US$7,000), and/or the revocation of the hospital’s license.
## Huge market for hospitals and healthcare facilities in Indonesia
Indonesia has one of the lowest hospital beds per thousand population in ASEAN at 388,105 beds or 1.49 beds per thousand. The low number of beds reflects the opportunity for foreign investors to fill this gap, especially in second-tier cities such as Bandung and Surabaya.
In the long term, Indonesia’s healthcare industry is expected to see continued growth as the expansion of the country’s middle-class and universal healthcare drive demand. Indonesia has the **world’s largest universal healthcare program**⟨95⟩, covering over 200 million people with those registered in the program able to receive free health services ranging from dental check-ups to organ transplants.
Further, other sub-sectors such as the pharmaceutical industry (which has also been liberalized to 100 percent foreign investment) are expected to see growth with demand being driven by products used to treat lifestyle diseases.

# Opportunities in Indonesia’s Financial Technology Sector
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/opportunities-in-indonesia-s-financial-technology-sector)
  * _Indonesia’s fintech industry is one of the most competitive and dynamic in ASEAN as evidenced by the emergence of four unicorns and one decacorn in the industry._
  * _The fintech industry is one of the most funded sectors and is dominated by peer-to-peer (P2P) lending and e-payment platforms._


Indonesia’s fintech industry is one of the most competitive and dynamic in ASEAN as evidenced by the emergence of four unicorns and one decacorn in the industry. The country is home to 20 percent of all fintech companies in the Southeast Asian bloc, which is expected to generate US$8.6 billion in revenues over the next five years, despite its infancy.
The fintech industry is one of the most funded sectors — along with e-commerce — and is dominated by peer-to-peer (P2P) lending (50 percent) and e-payment (23 percent) platforms. Despite having more than 300 fintech companies operating in Indonesia, foreign investors will find the industry has yet to fulfill its potential. One of the factors is that 60 percent of the country’s workforce is in the informal sector, and many micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) have little access to financing from banks, as they too are mostly operating in the informal sector.
![Composition-of-Indonesia’s-Fintech-Industry⟨93⟩](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Composition-of-Indonesia%E2%80%99s-Fintech-Industry.jpg)
## P2P lending
Many local MSMEs have business models that are not compatible with the characteristics of the banks’ financial products. That includes aspects such as payment terms for loan schemes, forms of collateral, and credit quality, among others.
Foreign fintech firms can plug this gap through new financing models that have the potential to serve Indonesia’s 47 million underbanked and 92 million unbanked adults. As of 2020, P2P lending reached US$7.7 billion from 160 fintech companies officially listed by the Financial Services Authority (OJK). This covered over 26 million borrowers throughout the country.
These microloans are popular because of their convenience as it normally takes just 24 hours for the funds to be disbursed, and the terms and maturity are small and short – with borrowers typically receiving not more than US$100. These are normally returned within a few weeks as there are often huge interest charges.
## E-wallets
Electronic money transactions rose by 173 percent in 2020 and have become indispensable to Indonesian consumers. The country is predicted to be the next battleground for digital payment apps, with Indonesia possessing many of the key characteristics that are critical for the adoption of digital payment systems.
Some 196 million people have access to the internet and the smartphone penetration rate is 60 percent; above the ASEAN region’s 51 percent. Moreover, the middle-class now comprises 20 percent of the population, a key segment in the growth of the digital economy.
Local players still dominate the market (over 30), and GoPay, OVO, Dana, and LinkAja are some of the frontrunners in the industry. 58 percent of consumers used GoPay, an e-wallet developed by local decacorn Gojek. The company partnered with Bank Jago to develop its e-wallet services, which saw gross transactional value of US$12 billion in 2020. GoJek raised US$1.2 billion in funds to take on its rival Grab. It is also currently in talks with local e-commerce giant Tokopedia in a possible US$18 billion merger.
Grab also has ambitious plans for Indonesia and the region. It owns shares in the Indonesian digital payment platform OVO and is used in more than 115 million devices in over 300 cities. OVO has plans to merge with another local digital payment platform, DANA, which is backed by Ant Financial. If completed, the deal would help Grab in its battle for market share with Gojek.
Since it loosened investment rules in 2016, foreign investors from SoftBank to Alibaba have entered Indonesia’s domestic market and are competing with local firms like Tokopedia, thus providing consumers with a wider variety of services at competitive prices.
For foreign investors in the e-wallet industry, it is essential that they deliver a customer-centric experience to allow customers to pay with the local payment method of their choice, ranging from mobile banking to payments via convenience stores. This is because while Indonesia has a high smartphone penetration rate, a sizeable portion of its population is unbanked.

## Cloud technology and big data analytics
Indonesia is embracing cloud technology at speed and scale and has attracted investments from the world’s largest tech companies. In a report compiled by the Boston Consulting Group, Indonesia’s public cloud market is projected to see a compound annual growth rate of 25 percent — to reach US$800 million by 2023. The growing number of digital natives and the expansion of digital unicorns is fast turning Indonesia into one of Asia-Pacific’s fastest-growing public cloud markets.
Alibaba gained a first-mover advantage over rivals Google, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft, has launched its second hyperscale data center in January 2019. Google Cloud was launched in Jakarta in June 2020, and AWS will invest US$2.85 billion to build data centers in Indonesia’s West Java province by end of 2021. Microsoft revealed plans in early February 2020 that it would also build data centers in the country.
The management of big data will be key to maximizing the future of Indonesia’s cloud technology industry. Big data will be of great importance in understanding consumer trends in the country, particularly in recording digital footprints through social media platforms. Many MSMEs are using Facebook and Instagram to reach their consumer base. These platforms have 140 million and 77 million users, respectively, as of 2020. It is estimated that the total number of social network users will reach 256 million by 2025.

# An Overview of Indonesia’s Geothermal Energy Sector
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/an-overview-of-indonesia-s-geothermal-energy-sector)
**_Indonesia is home to some 40 percent of the world’s geothermal resources, and the sector will be key to the country’s energy sustainability goals._**
* * *
Indonesia is one of the world’s leading geothermal energy powers and has ambitions to further grow the sector as the country embraces renewable energy sources.
Currently, Indonesia is the second largest producer of geothermal energy, trailing only the US, and has the world’s largest geothermal energy potential. Home to 
Geothermal energy is created by harnessing the heat produced by the earth, namely by using steam from underground reservoirs of hot water to power turbines that generate electricity. In most cases, energy developers access these underground reservoirs by drilling wells into the ground.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/an-overview-of-indonesia-s-geothermal-energy-sector)Despite Indonesia’s vast resources, investing in its geothermal sector presents numerous challenges, ranging from a difficult regulatory environment to a lack of supporting infrastructure. However, the sector presents promising long-term potential, particularly since the government has targeted geothermal production capacity to reach 5,000MW by 2025.
## Indonesia’s geothermal energy potential
Indonesia’s geography makes the island nation uniquely placed to tap into geothermal energy. Located by the Ring of Fire, the seismic activity surrounding Indonesia is extremely active, providing ample geothermal energy potential. Due to these features, Indonesia has an 
However, the underground reservoirs of hot water that geothermal energy depends on cannot be accessed everywhere. Even when developers identify a potential energy source, it is not clear how much energy it will produce until after explorers complete the expensive drilling process.
Challenges associated with identifying geothermal energy sources are also present in Indonesia, despite the country’s high levels of seismic activity. These challenges are exacerbated by Indonesia’s infrastructure deficits, which are especially acute in the remote, difficult-to-reach areas where underground reservoirs are typically found. Accordingly, while Indonesia has ample geothermal reserves, the costs and uncertainties associated with exploration, land clearing, and drilling remain a key challenge.
## Plans to develop geothermal energy
The Indonesian government is in the process of implementing ambitious plans to rapidly grow the geothermal energy sector. To date, progress towards reaching these goals has achieved mixed results.
According to the General Plan for National Energy (RUEN), Indonesia 
Although the development of geothermal energy in Indonesia has not progressed according to plan, it is still one of the largest producers of geothermal energy in the world. Currently, Indonesia has about 
More broadly, the Indonesian government seeks to have renewables constitute 23 percent of electricity generation by 2025, almost double from 12 percent currently. Indonesia 
At its current pace, Indonesia will likely fail to reach its renewable energy goal by 2023. For Indonesia to make up ground and achieve its longer them renewable energy goals, further expansion of geothermal energy is essential.
## **Market and regulatory barriers**
Developing geothermal energy in Indonesia presents a number of challenges, including the energy source’s positioning in the regulatory and market landscape. Geothermal energy in Indonesia continues to be significantly more expensive than coal, which is also abundant in the country. Coal makes up about 60 percent of Indonesia’s electricity production, and the government continues to 
With new coal plants in development, it is far from being phased out as a key energy source, even if its share gradually declines. In the absence of regulations that require the use of renewable energy, it is extremely challenging for geothermal energy producers to compete with the price of coal energy.

**Thursday, November 16, 2023 | 9:00 AM San Francisco / 12:00 PM New York / 6:00 PM Brussels / 1:00 AM (Nov. 17th) Beijing**
_Partner Kyle Freeman will introduce how key Asian economies are implementing the new changes, how companies are going to be impacted, and what businesses should be doing now._
Coal is not the only competitor to geothermal energy. Due to technological advancements, wind and solar power are increasingly cost-effective and competitive energy sources. In contrast, cost efficiencies in geothermal energy production – especially in Indonesia – have not kept pace.

Three state-owned enterprises 
The government is trying to address these various challenges by making the sector more attractive to foreign investors, via reforms through the Omnibus Law. Business lines involving exploration and drilling in the geothermal sector will be considered a priority business sector and companies can receive a tax allowance for such activities. Further, foreign capital ownership for projects in this sector has increased to 70 percent for ASEAN-based companies, and 67 percent for non-ASEAN-based companies.

# Indonesia Accounting Standards
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/taxation-and-accounting/accounting-standards)
## What are Indonesian accounting standards?
Indonesian Financial Accounting Standards (SAK) are the guiding principles that regulate accounting in Indonesia. These are set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (DSAK IAI) and the Indonesian Sharia Accounting Standards Board (DSAS IAI) - responsible for establishing the specific set of standards that businesses operating within Indonesia must adhere to.
  

Contributing Advisor
These financial accounting standards serve as a fundamental framework, ensuring that all businesses conform to the designated principles and policies. Moreover, they facilitate a standardized approach across all businesses, enabling straightforward comparisons between multiple entities. These accounting standards encompass various aspects of business financials, encompassing shareholders' equity, liabilities, and revenue, among others.
## Which standards are audits in Indonesia based on?
All public and private companies in Indonesia must follow the accounting standards laid out by the DSAK-IAI and DSAS-IAI.
Did You Know
Since 2015, the DSAK IAI has converged its accounting standards with that of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), issued by the IFRS Foundation and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
Current harmonization revolves around the chronological adoption of past IFRS with an emphasis on closing the gap between Indonesia’s adoption status and the most up-to-date international standards.
### Tiers of accounting standards in Indonesia
Indonesian Financial Accounting Standards (SAK) is broken down into the following tiers:
  * Tier 1 SAK – applies to listed companies and other entities with significant public accountability. Effective on 1 January 2015, the Indonesia Financial Accounting Standard (SAK) has fully converged with the International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS). This is part of Indonesia’s efforts to make local financial statements more comparable and understandable across international boundaries as the country aims to attract greater foreign investment and play a more prominent role within the G20.
  * Tier 2 SAK EP – applies to private entities. Private Entity SAK is intended for use by entities that do not have public accountability and issue general-purpose financial statements for external users. However, entities that have public accountability can use Private Entity SAK after obtaining permission from the appropriate regulatory authority. Private entities may also choose to adopt Tier 1 SAK.
  * Tier 3 – PSAK Syariah applies to companies that the Syariah principle for transaction. For example, Bank Syariah and other Syariah Financial Institutions.
  * Tier 4 – PSAK EMKM is for the micro, small, and medium enterprises.


## Bookkeeping in Indonesia
It is mandatory for every company operating within the country to maintain their bookkeeping locally. The process of maintaining company books in Indonesia involves several key aspects:
  * Preparation of Financial Statements: This includes the creation of various financial statements that provide a comprehensive overview of the company's financial position and performance. These statements typically include: 
    * Statement of Financial Position: This reflects the company's assets, liabilities, and owner's equity.
    * Profit and Loss Statement and Other Comprehensive Income: This document outlines the company's income, expenses, and overall profit or loss for the fiscal year.
    * Cash Flow Report: This report details the company's cash flow activities throughout the year.
    * Statement of Changes in Company Equity: This statement highlights any changes in the company's equity over the year.
    * Notes to the Financial Year: These are detailed explanations and descriptions of the items included in the aforementioned reports.
  * Maintenance of Accounting Records and Supporting Documents: Companies must keep thorough and organized records of their financial transactions. This includes retaining all relevant accounting records and supporting documents, such as sales invoices, vendor invoices, bank statements, agreements, contracts, and tax documents.
  * Document Retention: All these records and documents must be securely preserved for 10 years. Additionally, the financial statements for each year must include comparative figures from the previous years for comparison and analysis.


By adhering to these bookkeeping requirements, companies in Indonesia ensure compliance with local regulations and maintain accurate financial records for transparency and accountability.

### Fiscal year
The annual deadline for reporting and paying corporate income tax is April 30 – if a company’s fiscal year begins from January 1 – December 31. If a company’s fiscal year differs from the calendar year, then its deadline is four months after the end of its fiscal year.
### Language and currency
All accounting records must be in Bahasa Indonesian, and the financial books should be maintained in Rupiah.
However, there are exceptions for certain entities. Foreign-investment companies (Penanaman Modal Asing/PMA), permanent establishments (PEs), subsidiaries of foreign companies, taxpayers listed overseas, and taxpayers who present their financial statements in USD as per the applicable Financial Accounting Standards (Standar Akuntansi Keuangan/SAK) in Indonesia can maintain their books in USD and use English for their documentation. This exception is granted upon approval from the Director General of Taxes. It's important to note that the use of languages other than English and currencies other than USD in a company's books is strictly prohibited.
## Convergence of Indonesian Financial Accounting Standards (PSAK) with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
The financial reporting landscape has undergone significant and unprecedented transformations because of the Indonesian Financial Accounting Standard Board's (DSAK) commitment to fully adopt International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). A gradual transition approach, starting 2008, was chosen instead of a sudden shift, primarily to address interpretation and implementation challenges.
Phase 1 of the IFRS convergence has now been completed, and as of January 1, 2012, the Indonesian Financial Accounting Standards (PSAK) are substantially aligned with IFRS as of January 1, 2009.
Currently, the Indonesian Financial Accounting Standard Board (DSAK) is actively pursuing the second phase of IFRS convergence to reduce the gap between PSAK and IFRS from three years to just one year. Consequently, PSAK has been undergoing continuous changes over the past three years and will continue to do so in the future.
Foreign companies in Indonesia should contact local taxation and accounting professionals
This is part of Indonesia’s efforts to make local financial statements more comparable and understandable across international boundaries as the country aims to attract greater foreign investment and play a more prominent role within the G20.

# Opportunities in Indonesia’s Internet of Things Sector
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/sector-insights/opportunities-in-indonesia-s-internet-of-things-sector)
Indonesia’s Internet of Things market (IoT) is expected to reach US$30 billion by 2022, and the sector’s impact will be significant in reducing healthcare costs, enhancing industrial productivity, and reducing operational costs for businesses. The real potential of IoTs will be applying the technology to sectors that contribute to 50 percent of Indonesia’s economy, such as the manufacturing sector, agriculture, and natural resources.
IoT is slowly being implemented across more sub-sectors of Indonesia’s manufacturing landscape, transforming the traditional linear supply chains into interconnected digital systems that improve efficiency. The government aims to shift the country’s manufacturing capabilities to more high-value and complex products with IoT at the heart of this transformation.
This will be vital if Indonesia is to propel itself into a top 10 world economy by 2030. According to General Electric, the country’s manufacturing sector alone is performing at 30 to 35 percent with the government aiming to increase the sector’s contribution to GDP from 20 percent to 25 percent by 2025.
## Telehealth 
The integration of information and communication technology (ICT) into healthcare will also accelerate the sector’s reforms. Healthcare apps are seeing huge increases in active users during the pandemic and could transform the way hospitals and doctors collect, store, and share patient data.
Indonesian-based healthcare app Alodokter recorded more than 30 million active at the height of the pandemic in the country (one and a half times higher than pre-COVID-19 traffic). Such apps have helped reduce the burden on clinics and hospitals and are becoming increasingly important in a country where there are only 0.4 doctors per 1,000 population and 300,000 hospital beds. There is a huge demand in all aspects of healthcare in Indonesia – from pharmaceuticals to medical devices – due to the introduction of universal healthcare in 2014, considered the world’s largest, covering over 200 million people.
Healthcare apps have also partnered with ride-hailing apps, such as Gojek and Grab, to assist in the delivery of prescription medicine, and app customers can pay out of pocket, through the app’s own insurance program, or through private insurance from other partner companies.
## Online education
The onset of COVID-19 accelerated the adoption of educational technology (edtech) in Indonesia’s education sector. Over 530,000 schools were forced to close, impacting over 68 million students from pre-primary to tertiary levels. The past two years have seen the growth of local platforms, such as Ruangguru (an e-learning platform for K12 students), Harukaedu (a platform offering online university degrees), and Cakap (a platform for language learning), but the sector is still in its infancy.
Indonesia’s edtech sector currently lacks the capacity to scale up as many lower-income students lack access to devices needed to use edtech tools and download speeds in rural regions are not as high as in urban areas.
Foreign edtech firms can address these constraints through partnerships with local academia and the government to establish standards for e-learning. There is inconsistent education quality, even prior to the pandemic, which drove many students (especially in the more affluent middle-class) to seek online extracurricular courses and tuitions. International edtech providers can also focus on specific niches and more personalized services within the education industry. This includes providing language courses or concentrating on a target age group.
Furthermore, there are relatively untapped opportunities in providing edtech for corporations. Some 40 million people will join the production demographic by 2040, meaning a total working population of 190 million. This large workforce will need new skills and retraining to remain relevant for the future. Foreign companies can provide corporate training programs through e-learning deliveries that help save travel time from training venues.
## Cloud technology and big data analytics
Indonesia is embracing cloud technology at speed and scale and has attracted investments from the world’s largest tech companies. In a report compiled by the Boston Consulting Group, Indonesia’s public cloud market is projected to see a compound annual growth rate of 25 percent — to reach US$800 million by 2023. The growing number of digital natives and the expansion of digital unicorns is fast-turning Indonesia into one of Asia-Pacific’s fastest-growing public cloud markets.
Alibaba gained a first-mover advantage over rivals Google, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft, has launched its second hyper-scale data center in January 2019. Google Cloud was launched in Jakarta in June 2020, and AWS launched its first data center in Indonesia in late 2021. Microsoft revealed plans in early February 2020 that it would also build data centers in the country.
The management of big data will be key to maximizing the future of Indonesia’s cloud technology industry. Big data will be of great importance in understanding consumer trends in the country, particularly in recording digital footprints through social media platforms. Many MSMEs are using Facebook and Instagram to reach their consumer base. These platforms have 140 million and 77 million users, respectively, as of 2020. It is estimated that the total number of social network users will reach 256 million by 2025.
## Telecommunications, 4G rollout, and 5G potential
Indonesia completed the Palapa Ring project in late 2019, providing 4G internet access to more than 500 cities and regencies across the archipelago. The project is estimated to have cost US$1.5 billion and comprises 35,000km (21,747 miles) of undersea fiber-optic cables and 21,000km (13,000 miles) of land cables, stretching from the westernmost city in Indonesia, Sabang, to the easternmost town, Merauke. Additionally, the cables also transverse every district from the northernmost island, Mianagas, to the southernmost island, Rote. 
Through the Palapa Ring, the government can facilitate a network capacity of up to 100 Gbps in even the most outlying regions of the country. The government hopes that improved internet connectivity can significantly impact industries across the country and encourage economic development.
Schools that can now access high-speed internet can improve the digital literacy rate and product engineers and other tech talents that can advance the information and communications technology sector. Greater connectivity will also provide opportunities in the financial technology market and increase banking penetration – less than half the adult population owns a bank account.
Foreign investors can own up to 67 percent ownership in the telecommunications sector, which includes the following business activities:
  * The operator of telecommunications network (short messaging service, multimedia messaging service);
  * The operator of telecommunications services; 
    * Telephony services providers;
    * Internet service providers;
    * Data communication system providers;
    * Content service providers (ringtones);
    * Telephony internet service providers;
    * Internet interconnection services (network access point) providers; and
    * Other multimedia service providers.


Indonesia is also the fourth largest cellular market with more than 330 million subscribers. However, the market is controlled by five providers, meaning there is room for competition, with 45 percent of subscriptions being dominated by 2G technology. Operators are continuing to expand their 4G network coverage to more rural areas.

# Taxation and Accounting
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/taxation-and-accounting)
Taxation affects almost all aspects of doing business in Indonesia. Companies and individuals must understand the taxation system, filing requirements, and tax obligations to comply with Indonesian laws.
  

Contributing Advisor
Indonesia’s parliament has approved the Harmonized Tax Law (HTL), which overhauls the existing tax structure. Changes include an increase in the value-added tax (VAT) rate, a new carbon tax, scrapped plans to reduce the corporate income tax (CIT), and changes to the topline personal income tax (PIT) rate.
The tax system is still evolving at a rapid pace as authorities seek to improve transparency, compliance, and the ease of doing business in the country. The law aims to optimize tax revenue collection and compliance to aid economic recovery for the country.
In this guide, we discuss: 
  * Tax laws, their administration, and applicability;
  * Tax calculation methods for different taxes;
  * Transfer pricing and advance pricing agreements⟨93⟩;
  * Tax incentives for doing business in Indonesia;⟨94⟩
  * Audit and compliance⟨95⟩; and,
  * Indonesia’s accounting standards⟨96⟩.


## Summary of tax rates
Tax |  Standard Rate |  Variations |  Abbreviation  
---|---|---|---  
Corporate Income Tax |  22% |  Reduced CIT under certain conditions |  CIT  
Value Added Tax |  11% |  12%, 0% |  VAT  
Withholding Tax |  15%, 20% |  15%, 20%  
Stamp Duty |  IDR 10,000 (US$0.70)  
Luxury-goods sales tax |  10%-125% |  10%-125%  
Individual Income Tax |  5%-35% |  5%-35% |  IIT  
### Major laws governing taxation
  * Harmonized Tax Law (HTL) or Law No. 7/2021;
  * Income Tax Law;
  * Value Added Tax ("VAT") Law;
  * General Tax Provisions and Procedures ("GTP") Law;
  * Investment Law;
  * Excise Law; and,
  * Carbon Tax Law.


## Corporate Income Tax
The corporate income tax rate (CIT) is 22 percent for 2023.
There are several facilities given to businesses regarding CIT if they fulfill the following conditions:
  * Companies that are listed on the stock exchange that offer the minimum requirement of 40 percent of total share capital are subjected to a three percent tax cut from the standard rate;
  * Companies that have an annual turnover of 50 billion rupiah (US$3.2 million) are eligible for a 50 percent tax cut from the standard rate, which is imposed proportionally on the part of the gross turnover of up to 4.8 billion rupiah (US$309,500); and
  * Companies with gross turnover of no more than 4.8 billion rupiah (US$309,500) are subject to a 0.5 percent tax on total turnover.

## Individual Income Tax
An individual’s income is subject to 5% to 35% of progressive income tax rates.
Expatriate workers need to know that personal income tax (PIT) in Indonesia is determined through a self-assessment scheme.
The country has adopted a worldwide income taxation system, meaning that individuals considered Indonesian tax residents must pay tax to the government on the income they earned in Indonesia, and also on income they earned from abroad, unless there is an applicable double tax agreement.
Non-resident taxpayers will only be liable to pay PIT for income they earn in Indonesia unless the country in which they are a tax resident has an applicable tax treaty with Indonesia. In these cases, the taxpayer might not pay any tax in Indonesia or pay a reduced amount.
Did You Know
Effective fiscal year 2022, the lowest tax bracket cap for individual income tax will be increased from IDR 50 million to IDR 60 million and a new 35% tax bracket will be added for individuals earning more than IDR 5 billion annually.
Given these tax treatments, it is important for expatriate workers to understand their tax liabilities in Indonesia. It is advisable to use the services of registered local tax advisors to help determine which tax law regime will be applicable along with any exemptions that may be brought.

## Value Added Tax
Taxpayers pay VAT at a rate of 11%.
Value-added tax in Indonesia is imposed on the provision of services or the transfer of taxable goods. VAT rates are set out below:
  * Export of tangible and intangible goods is subject to zero percent VAT; and
  * The export of services is subject to zero percent VAT.


The government’s negative list sets out all the goods and services that are non-taxable
Around 25 percent of Indonesia’s tax revenue or 298.84 trillion rupiah (US$20.9 billion) last year came from domestic VAT.

## Indonesia international taxation
International taxation in Indonesia mainly comprises two entities: the transfer pricing and advanced pricing agreement.
### Transfer pricing
Transfer pricing applies to companies that transact between companies from the same group, such as a subsidiary, or other ‘related’ parties.
Transfer pricing in Indonesia is regulated under the Income Tax Law of 2008, which authorizes a tax officer to redetermine the tax income of a taxpayer who has a ‘special relationship’ with other taxpayers.
### Advanced Pricing Agreement (APA)
In 2020, the Directorate General of Taxes issued Regulation No.22/PMK.03/2020 (PMK-22) governing the implementation of advanced pricing agreements (APA).
An APA is an agreement between one or more taxpayers and one or more tax authorities to determine in advance a set of criteria, within a specific period, for specific cross-border transactions. This is to ensure such transactions comply with the arm’s length principle as well as assist in avoiding transfer pricing disputes.

## Tax incentives for businesses
Tax incentives are preferential tax policies offered by the government to incentivize or encourage a particular economic activity or to support disadvantaged business owners or individuals. From the investor’s perspective, tax incentives are legitimate tools for reasonable tax planning and cost savings. They are a useful indicator of market trends and government priorities.

There are multiple forms of tax incentives available to businesses, such as tax exemptions, tax reductions, lower tax rates, tax refunds or rebates, tax credits, etc.
Indonesia offers a series of tax incentives for businesses that invest in labor-intensive industries, training programs, research and development (R&D), a variety of income tax incentives for businesses investing in specific industries and provinces in the country, businesses that invest in developing talent, and more.
Tax incentives are usually based on:
  * **Type of tax** : Such as corporate income tax (CIT), and value-added tax (VAT)
  * **Size of business** : Such small- and medium-sized enterprises and cooperatives.
  * **Sector-wise** : Companies that invest a certain amount in one of the 246 priority business lines will be afforded fiscal and non-fiscal incentives.
  * **Region-based** : A variety of income tax incentives for businesses investing in specific provinces (such as Aceh, Greater Jakarta, and Riau) or Indonesia’s new capital Nusantara.


Taken together, the incentives are designed to encourage more foreign direct investment (FDI), expand the skilled labor base, and develop industry.

## Accounting and audit in Indonesia
### Indonesia accounting standards
Audits are to be conducted based on the Indonesian Financial Accounting Standards (SAK), which are set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (DSAK IAI) and the Indonesian Sharia Accounting Standards Board (DSAS IAI), for Sharia-based companies.
Further, the DSAK IAI has converged its accounting standards with that of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), issued by the IFRS Foundation and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). Current harmonization revolves around the chronological adoption of past IFRS with emphasis on closing the gap between Indonesia’s adoption status and the most up-to-date international standards.
 Read more⟨60⟩ Gain more insights about accounting standards in Indonesia, in this section.⟨60⟩
### Audit and compliance in Indonesia
Foreign investors will need to be aware that regulations regarding auditing, accounting, and financial reporting are stipulated over several laws and bylaws, and that a good understanding of these can ensure their business stays compliant.
Did You Know
There is currently no single unifying regulation on auditing and compliance in Indonesia. 
Foreign investors should, however, focus on the Company Law, which dictates the terms for when audits become obligatory in addition to the accounting standards companies should adhere to when preparing financial statements.
Investors should use the services of registered local advisors to make sure they understand the prevailing regulations.

# List of Banks in Indonesia 2024
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/tools/list-of-banks-in-indonesia-2023)
Indonesia's banking sector has experienced a profound transformation, evolving from its modest beginnings to becoming a robust and modern financial pillar in the Southeast Asian economy. As the nation's central bank, Bank Indonesia has been instrumental in directing monetary policy and fostering sector stability, even amidst global economic disruptions.

The journey of the Indonesian banking system showcases the nation's economic tenacity and adaptability. As the banking sector matured, it successfully navigated through international financial turbulence, welcomed strategic reforms, and leveraged technological innovation to enhance efficiency and customer service. The bank's vigilant oversight and strategic policymaking remain essential in maintaining the momentum of growth and innovation in Indonesia's banking industry.

# List of International Chamber of Commerce in Indonesia Guide
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/tools/list-of-international-chamber-of-commerce-in-indonesia-guide)
Indonesia, with its strategic geographical location and economy⟨90⟩, has become a hub for international trade⟨7⟩. The International Chamber of Commerce enhances business relationships between Indonesia and the world. They act as bridges, connecting Indonesian businesses with international markets and vice versa.
These chambers facilitate networking, provide business insights, and help navigate the complex international business environment. They organize events, seminars, and workshops, bringing together business leaders and policymakers.
The presence of these chambers positively influences Indonesia’s GDP,⟨4⟩ employment rates, and trade balance. They help in attracting foreign investment and promoting Indonesian products in the global market.
We have created a list of the largest international business associations in Indonesia to aid anyone who needs to identify some or many of the foreign Chambers of Commerce in Indonesia.

# Audit and Compliance in Indonesia
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/taxation-and-accounting/audit-and-compliance)
There is currently no single unifying regulation on auditing and compliance in Indonesia.
  

Contributing Advisor
Foreign investors must be aware that regulations regarding auditing, accounting, and financial reporting are stipulated over several laws and by laws, and that a good understanding of these can ensure their business stays compliant.
Foreign investors should focus on Company Law, which dictates the terms for when audits become obligatory in addition to the accounting standards companies should adhere to when preparing financial statements.
Investors should use the services of registered local advisors to make sure they understand the prevailing regulations.
## Auditing and compliance requirements
The Investment Law lays out the basic requirements on how to operate in Indonesia. These are part of key compliance norms:
  * Implementing good corporate governance;
  * Undertake corporate social responsibility activities;
  * Comply with the labor law;
  * Submit quarterly investment activities to the Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM); and
  * Honor the cultural traditions of communities.


## Who is obligated to be audited?
The Company Law mandates that financial statements of a limited liability company must be audited by a public accountant registered in Indonesia if they meet at least one of the following criteria:
  * Companies with assets exceeding 50 billion rupiah (US$3.2 million);
  * Public companies;
  * Companies that issue debt instruments;
  * Certain types of state-owned enterprises; or
  * The company collects or manages public funds (such as banks and insurance companies).


By law, a company must keep its accounting records and books for at least 10 years from the end of its reporting period.
## Annual reports
All registered company’s annual financial statements are to be submitted to a regional tax office once a year. Financial statements consist of the following:
  * Balance sheet;
  * Cash flows;
  * Profit and loss statement; and
  * Statement of changes in equity.


Financial statements are required to provide both the current and previous year’s figures and need to be presented on a comparative basis.
Periodic financial statements must be presented in the Indonesian language and a foreign language. The obligation to use foreign languages does not apply to small- and medium-sized enterprises. Periodic financial statements that utilize foreign languages must contain the same information as the periodic financial statements that use the Indonesian language.
If there is a difference in the interpretation of the information presented in foreign languages with those presented in the Indonesian language, the information in the Indonesian language shall be used as a reference. 
The accounting books must also use the rupiah as their currency. Companies will need to seek permission from the tax authorities for the use of the US dollar, the only other eligible functional currency. This must be done no later than three months before the start of the accounting year.
## Public companies
Under the Capital Markets Law, foreign companies are allowed to be listed in the country’s bourse.
Their prospectus, however, must first be audited by an auditing firm that is recognized by the country’s Financial Services Authority (OJK), the main regulator of Indonesia’s financial services sector.

The annual financial statement must be submitted to the OJK and announced to the public by no later than the end of the third month from the date of the annual financial statement. The submission of periodic financial statements must be conducted through the electronic reporting system of the OJK.
Public companies must also establish internal audit committees, an internal audit unit, and a company secretary. The audit committee supports the board of commissioners to ensure the effectiveness and integrity of a company’s financial statements and internal controls.
The committee will also review the risk management activities conducted by the board of directors and oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the internal and external auditors.

## Auditor independence
The auditor must be a registered and independent public accountant as stipulated by the Ministry of Finance (MOF). They must avoid all potential conflicts of interest and adhere to MOF regulations.
Did You Know
The MOF does not allow a company to use the services of an auditing firm for six consecutive years unless there have been significant changes in partners at the company. 
The Indonesia Financial Services Authority stipulates the mandatory rotation of the public accountant every three years with a two-year cooling period. This only applies to the public accountant and not the public accountant firm.
## One-month rule
Taxpayers undergoing an audit must furnish the documents and information requested by tax auditors within one month of the request date. Failure to comply within this timeframe may lead the Directorate General of Taxes (DGT) to assess tax liabilities based on deemed profits. Any documents or information not provided within the specified period cannot later be utilized by the taxpayer to contest the assessed tax amount.
Following the conclusion of a tax audit, the taxpayer will receive a written notification detailing the audit findings from the tax auditors. In the event of disagreement, the taxpayer must respond in writing. Subsequently, during the closing conference discussion, the taxpayer can reaffirm its stance regarding the tax audit corrections and provide pertinent supporting documents.
If there remains a dispute regarding the legal basis of an adjustment during the discussion of the tax audit findings, the taxpayer has the option to request a discussion with the Quality Tax Audits and Tax Assessments Assurance Team (QAT). This team is appointed either by the Regional Tax Office or the Directorate of Tax Audit and Collection.
### Fiscal year
The annual deadline for reporting and paying corporate income tax is April 30 – if a company’s fiscal year begins from January 1 – December 31. If a company’s fiscal year differs from the calendar year, then its deadline is four months after the end of its fiscal year.
### Penalties for non-compliance
Companies that fail to comply with Indonesia’s audit and tax requirements can expect to receive monthly interest penalties starting from two percent and up to 48 percent. Furthermore, issuing false tax and accounting documents can also result in imprisonment.
## Tax collection through a distress warrant
If a taxpayer fails to pay a legally mandated tax collection instrument within the specified timeframe, the Directorate General of Taxes (DGT) is empowered to issue a Distress Warrant (_Surat Paksa_). These instruments encompass various documents such as Tax Collection Letters (Surat Tagihan Pajak/STP), Overpaid Tax Assessment Letter (_Surat Ketetapan Pajak Lebih Bayar_ /SKPLB), (_Surat Ketetapan Pajak Kurang Bayar_ /SKPKB), Tax Objection Decision Letters, Tax Court Decisions, and Correction Decision Letters, all of which may require additional payments from the taxpayer.
The taxpayer in question is obligated to settle any underpaid tax specified in the tax collection instrument within one month of its issuance. Failure to do so incurs an interest penalty, calculated based on the applicable monthly Ministry of Finance Interest Rate, for a maximum period of 24 months.
If the underpaid tax remains outstanding beyond the specified timeframe, the DGT may proceed with the following steps as part of executing the Distress Warrant:
  * Issuance of a Warning Letter (_Surat Teguran_) if the underpaid tax is not resolved within seven days of the due date.
  * Issuance of a Distress Warrant if the underpaid tax remains unsettled within 21 days of the Warning Letter issuance.
  * Implementation of a Confiscation Order (_Surat Sita_) if the underpaid tax is not resolved within 48 hours of the Distress Warrant issuance.
  * Publication of an auction announcement regarding the confiscated assets if the underpaid tax persists beyond 14 days from the Confiscation Order issuance.
  * Conduct a public auction within 14 days of the auction announcement.


## Tax disputes
Tax disputes between taxpayers and the DGT typically stem from disagreements arising after the issuance of an SKP by the DGT, which the taxpayer contests. Legal tax collection instruments such as an SKPKB, an SKPKBT, and an STP serve as the basis for the DGT to issue a Distress Warrant if the taxpayer fails to settle the underpaid tax promptly.
There are several avenues available to address such tax disputes:
### Objections
A taxpayer dissenting from an SKP can lodge an Objection with the DGT within three months from the SKP's date of issue. The Objection must outline the taxpayer's calculated tax amount and provide reasons for disputing the DGT's tax assessment.
The DGT is obligated to render a decision on the tax Objection within 12 months of its filing date. Failure by the DGT to issue a decision within this timeframe automatically results in the Objection being deemed approved by the DGT.
### Appeals
If the DGT rejects the Objection, any underpayment incurs a surcharge of 30 percent. However, if the taxpayer lodges an Appeal with the Tax Court regarding the Objection Decision, neither the underpaid tax nor the surcharge is payable.
Additionally, taxpayers have the option to file an Objection with the DGT office concerning tax withheld by a third party, subject to the same time limits for filing and the DGT's decision.
Regarding Appeals, if a taxpayer disagrees with the DGT's Objection Decision, they can submit an Appeal to the Tax Court within three months of receiving the DGT's decision. According to the Tax Court Law, at least 50 percent of the tax due must be settled before filing the Appeal if the DGT's decision calls for a tax payment.
The Tax Court typically renders a decision on appeals within 12 months. Any underpaid tax resulting from the Tax Court's decision is subject to a surcharge of 60 percent.

# List of Government Agencies Website List That Help Businesses in Indonesia
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/tools/list-of-government-agencies-website-list-that-help-businesses-in-indonesia)
Indonesia is a land of potential for entrepreneurs and established businesses. Integral to this ecosystem are the government agencies designed to catalyze growth and facilitate business operations.
Government agencies act as the pillars of economic development, offering guidance, resources, and regulatory frameworks essential for businesses to thrive. Their involvement is pivotal in ensuring a balanced and progressive business environment. This article sheds light on government agencies' list and the invaluable support they extend to businesses across the archipelago.
## Indonesian Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM)
This agency serves to position Indonesia as a desirable location for investment, both from within and outside the country. 
BKPM has made strides in refining the licensing process, a common bottleneck for many businesses attempting to enter the Indonesian market. By cutting through the proverbial red tape, the board significantly reduces the time and effort required to obtain business licenses.
## Ministry of Law and Human Rights
The Ministry of Law and Human Rights in Indonesia, Kementerian Hukum dan Hak Asasi Manusia (
  * **Regulation of Business Entities** : The ministry is responsible for the legal framework governing business entities' establishment, operation, and dissolution⟨39⟩. This includes the registration of new companies, which is done through the Director General of General Legal Administration (Ditjen AHU). 
  * **Intellectual Property Protection** : Through the Directorate General of Intellectual Property, the ministry provides services related to the protection of intellectual property rights (IPR)⟨45⟩. This includes the registration of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and industrial designs. Protection of IPR is crucial for businesses as it safeguards their innovations and creative works against infringement, thereby promoting fair competition and encouraging innovation.
  * **Legal Framework for Foreign Investment** : For foreign investors, the ministry outlines the legal requirements and rights for conducting business in Indonesia, such as the processes for obtaining the necessary permits and understanding the regulations that apply specifically to foreign-owned companies.
  * **Human Rights Compliance** : The ministry ensures that businesses operate in accordance with the human rights standards recognized by Indonesia through the protection of workers' rights⟨46⟩, prohibition of child labor, and ensuring non-discriminatory practices in the workplace.
  * **Contract Enforcement and Legal Certainty** : By providing a clear legal framework, the ministry facilitates contract enforcement and dispute resolution, which are essential for business operations. 
  * **Law Reform and Legal Development** : The ministry is involved in drafting and revising laws that affect the business sector, such as Company Law, Bankruptcy Law, and Commercial Law. 
  * **Notary Services and Legal Documentation** : Notaries in Indonesia fall under the ministry's purview. They are essential for the preparation and authentication of a wide range of business-related documents, such as deeds of establishment, articles of association, and various contracts.
  * **Immigration Control for Business Entities** : The ministry manages immigration policies that affect businesses, especially in hiring foreign employees⟨47⟩. The Directorate General of Immigration administers visas and work permits⟨64⟩, which are crucial for businesses that rely on international talent.
  * **Public Service and Administration** : It offers various public services that facilitate business operations, such as the provision of electronic services for company registration, legal consultations, and providing information on prevailing laws and regulations.

### Policy Development
The Ministry also plays a role in the formulation of trade policies that can enhance the competitiveness of Indonesian businesses. These policies may relate to tariffs, trade barriers, or incentives for businesses that are looking to export.
### Barrier Reduction
The Ministry works to identify and reduce trade barriers, whether they are tariff-related, logistical, or regulatory. By doing so, the Ministry helps to create a smoother path for businesses reaching out to global markets.
### Business Support Services
The Ministry offers a range of support services to businesses, which can include matchmaking with potential international buyers, facilitating participation in trade fairs, and providing export training programs.
### Advocacy and Negotiation
The Ministry acts as an advocate for Indonesian businesses on the international stage. This may involve negotiating trade agreements that open new markets or improve terms of trade for Indonesian exporters.
### Trade Promotion

## Ministry of Finance
The 
### Tax Relief and Incentives
The Ministry of Finance formulates tax relief that could come in different forms, such as reduced corporate tax rates, tax holidays, or allowances for certain industries or activities considered beneficial for the country’s economic growth⟨4⟩. 
### Access to Financing Options
Ensuring that businesses have access to the necessary capital to start and grow is crucial. The Ministry of Finance may work to facilitate this in various ways:
#### For Capital-Intensive Ventures
These types of businesses require a significant amount of capital to purchase machinery, build infrastructure, or make other large-scale investments. The ministry might develop programs that offer loans with favorable terms, government guarantees, or even direct funding in some cases. By doing so, it lowers the barrier to entry for these ventures and makes it feasible for them to operate and expand.
#### For Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)
SMEs are often considered the backbone of the economy but may need help accessing traditional banking loans due to perceived higher risks or lack of collateral. The Ministry of Finance can introduce microfinance options, credit guarantee schemes, or even special funds dedicated to SMEs to ensure these businesses can access the capital they need to thrive.
### Facilitating Investment
In partnership with other governmental bodies, the Ministry of Finance might work to simplify the process of obtaining financing, such as streamlining application procedures, reducing processing times, and providing clear guidelines on how to qualify for and access different financing options.
### Regulatory Framework
While not directly mentioned, it is implied that the Ministry of Finance would also be involved in creating a regulatory environment that supports businesses. This might include simplifying tax compliance procedures, ensuring transparent tax regulations, and providing clear information on the financial support available to businesses.
### Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs)
For infrastructural and development projects, the ministry may play a role in structuring PPPs to leverage private sector efficiency and funding in public projects, which can be essential for creating a supportive ecosystem for business growth.
### Economic Stability and Policy Making
Through its broader role in managing the country’s finances, the Ministry of Finance contributes to creating a stable economic environment vital for business confidence and investment. Predictable economic policies and responsible fiscal management can help mitigate business risks, encouraging domestic and foreign investment.
## Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs
The 
Consequently, the ministry provides financial assistance to SMEs, which can range from facilitating access to loans and grants to offering subsidies or tax incentives. The ministry also cultivates a supportive ecosystem for SMEs by offering guidance and resources that address the various challenges of running a business. This system could include consulting services on best practices, marketing strategies, and technology adoption to streamline operations and reduce costs.
## Sector-Specific Agencies
Indonesia's approach to business support also extends to specialized sectors through dedicated agencies.
### Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT)
This agency spearheads technological advancement and application. As an institution, the 
The agency acts as a bridge between technological innovation and commercial application, providing support in research and development, technology transfer, and expertise and consultancy services. For companies looking to embrace modernization, the BPPT serves as a crucial resource, offering insights and access to the latest technological advancements tailored to their specific needs.
### National Agency of Drug and Food Control (BPOM)

The primary role of BPOM is to protect consumers by ensuring that all pharmaceuticals, food products, and other consumables meet stringent safety standards before they are allowed onto the market.

# Value Added Tax in Indonesia
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/taxation-and-accounting/value-added-tax-in-indonesia)
Taxpayers pay VAT at a rate of 11%.
  

Contributing Advisor
Businesses are required to register for VAT once they reach an annual revenue of 4.8 billion rupiah (US$309,500), with businesses earning an annual revenue of less than this figure are allowed to register for VAT voluntarily.
## VAT rate
Value-added tax in Indonesia is imposed on the provision of services or the transfer of taxable goods. VAT rates are set out below:
  * 11 percent imposed on most manufacturers, retailers, wholesalers, and importers from April 2022 and 12 percent by 2025;
  * Export of tangible and intangible goods is subject to zero percent VAT; and
  * The export of services is subject to zero percent VAT.


Taxable goods and services include:
  * The import of taxable goods;
  * The delivery of taxable services or import of taxable goods into a customs area;
  * The consumption of taxable goods in a customs area in which the goods have originated from outside the customs area;
  * The consumption of taxable services originating from outside the customs area, in the customs area; and
  * The export of taxable goods by a VATable entity.


## Goods and services not subject to VAT
The government sets out which goods and services are categorized as non-taxable.
### Non-taxable goods
Non-taxable goods are the following:
  * Food and beverages served in restaurants and hotels;
  * Products obtained from drilling or mining such as natural gas, crude oil, coal, gold ore, iron ore, coal, copper ores;
  * Commodities such as rice, eggs, milk, fruit, tubers, meat, sugar, soybeans, and salt;
  * Gold bars, money used for government forex reserves.


### Non-taxable services
Non-taxable services are the following:
  * Entertainment, hotel, parking, catering, and art services;
  * Educational services;
  * Medical and health services;
  * Public transportation services;
  * Financial services; and
  * Labor services.


## VAT reporting
Entities obligated to pay VAT must settle their VAT liabilities on their business activities every month. Furthermore, since Indonesia’s VAT regime is decentralized, businesses with multiple branches located in different jurisdictions of the district tax offices must register each branch with the relevant tax office.
## VAT on digital services
Non-resident suppliers of digital services within Indonesia can now be appointed as VAT collectors. As such, are now required to collect 11 percent VAT and pay to the Indonesian government.
The following utilization of intangible goods will now be subject to VAT:
  * The use of or right to exercise the copyright in the field of literature, art or scientific work, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark, or other forms of intellectual property right, industrial property right, or other similar rights;
  * The utilization or right to use industrial, commercial, or scientific tools/equipment;
  * Utilization of knowledge or information obtained from the scientific, technical, industrial, or commercial sectors;
  * The use of additional or complementary assistance in the utilization or right to exercise the right as referred to in the first point, the utilization or right to use the tools/equipment as referred to in the second point, or provision of knowledge or information as referred to in the third point;
  * The use of or the right to use motion picture films, films, or video tapes for television broadcasting, or sound tapes for radio broadcasts; and
  * The acquisition of all or part of the rights relating to the use or granting of intellectual property rights, industrial property rights, or other rights as referred to in the above-mentioned points.

## VAT exemption
Certain imports can be exempted from VAT. These include:
  * The import of taxable goods into free trade zones;
  * Import of services and goods financed by foreign aid;
  * Import of raw materials by companies in bonded zones; and
  * Imports made by companies in specific industries such as national airlines.


## VAT refunds
All decisions related to VAT refunds are approved by Indonesia’s Directorate General of Taxes (DGT). Entities that apply for VAT refunds have to undergo an audit by DGT and the results are normally issued 12 months after their application.
## Export services eligible for zero-rated VAT
The following types of exported services are subject to zero-rated VAT:
  * Toll manufacturing;
  * Repair and maintenance;
  * Freight forwarding services for export-orientated goods;
  * Construction consulting services (which includes the development of feasibility studies, assessments, and designing of a building or master plan that is located outside of Indonesia);
  * Information and technology services;
  * Research and development services;
  * Charter of aircraft or ships for international flights or shipping services;
  * Business consultation and management;
  * Legal consultation;
  * Architecture and interior design consulting;
  * HR consulting;
  * Marketing;
  * Engineering;
  * Accounting or bookkeeping;
  * Taxation;
  * Financial audits;
  * Trading services to find Indonesian suppliers for export purposes; and
  * Interconnection, satellite providers, and/or communication and data


Export services eligible for zero-rated VAT must comply with two formal requirements.
There must be a written agreement between the Indonesian taxable business and the foreign recipient that must include the type of service, the value of the exported services, and a description of the service provided by the Indonesian taxable business that will be utilized by the foreign recipient, and show supporting documents for payments from the recipient of the exported service to the Indonesian service provider.
Failure to meet the above requirements will mean the service is deemed to have occurred within the territory of Indonesia and will be subject to 10 percent VAT.
Did You Know
Previous Indonesian governments have been reluctant to liberalize the country’s services sector despite its increasingly influential role in the economy; it accounted for 45 percent of the GDP in 2018. Furthermore, the sector has become the largest source of job creation, constituting 45 percent of total employment in the country in 2018.
### VAT during pre-production period
A VAT-able entity is considered to not have made a delivery if they have not exported or delivered any VAT-able services or goods. Any deliveries made for the entity’s own use, as gifts for customers, or deliveries from a head office or branch office, are not considered as deliveries when assessing if an entity has moved beyond the pre-production stage.
The pre-production stage is generally three years, which is extended for manufacturing sectors and business sectors under the National Strategic Projects to five or six years, respectively.
### VAT credit
Input VAT cannot be credited and must be paid back to the state treasury by the VAT-able entity if the entity has received a refund of the tax overpayment and/or has credited the input VAT as output VAT payable in a tax period.
### Crediting input VAT before becoming a VAT-able entity
If the Directorate General of Tax deems an entity to be VAT-able, then the input VAT before this can now be creditable 80 percent of the output VAT.

# Where to Invest 
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/where-to-invest)
Indonesia offers a favorable environment for investment - with different regions offering business-friendly policies and investment incentives. However, which regions offer optimal conditions for different industries?
  

Contributing Advisor
With 17000 islands varying in quality, reliability and availability of logistics, infrastructure, and utility services, we discuss the potential hot spots for foreign investors when choosing where to invest in Indonesia.
## Overview of Indonesia’s key economic regions
For foreign investors, entering Indonesia’s special economic zones (SEZ) and taking full advantage of what they offer requires a long-term outlook. Companies must first ensure their industry is suited to the infrastructure and benefits afforded in the SEZs and understand the long-term domestic and regional policies that could impact their industry.
Did You Know
As of April 2023, here are 20 **SEZs in Indonesia**⟨10⟩ of which 12 are in operation and the remainder are in the construction phase. Nine are designated for tourism with the rest for manufacturing and processing.
Indonesia’s government has made the development of the country’s special economic zones (SEZ) a priority policy with the aim of attracting over US$50 billion in foreign investment over the next decade, particularly for SEZ-oriented manufacturing.
![](https://www.asiabriefing.com/userfiles/country-guides/Indonesia/Doing-Business-in-ASEAN---Indonesia-portal-infogs-5.jpg)
Within an SEZ, the following business activities can be undertaken:
  * Production and processing;
  * Logistics and distribution;
  * Research, digital economy, and technology development;
  * Tourism;
  * Energy development;
  * Education;
  * Healthcare;
  * Sports;
  * Financial services;
  * Creative industries;
  * SEZ development and management; and
  * Procurement of SEZ infrastructure.


Investors operating in Indonesia’s SEZs will find they are supported by well-integrated infrastructure from highways, drainage systems, high-speed internet and communication systems, ports, and airports.

Moreover, the Indonesian government has prepared an array of fiscal and non-fiscal incentives, such as easier immigration process, corporate income tax reductions, exemptions on import duties and excise duties, among many others.
For foreign investors, entering Indonesia’s special economic zones and taking full advantage of what they offer requires a long-term outlook. Companies must first ensure their industry is suited to the infrastructure and benefits afforded in the SEZs, as well as understand the long-term domestic and regional policies that could impact their industry.

# An Introduction to Special Economic Zones in Indonesia
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/where-to-invest/an-introduction-to-special-economic-zones-in-indonesia)
Indonesia’s government has made the development of the country’s special economic zones (SEZ) a priority policy with the aim of attracting over US$50 billion in foreign investment over the next decade, particularly for SEZ-oriented manufacturing.
As of 2022, there are 19 SEZs of which 12 are in operation and the remainder in the construction phase. Eight are designated for tourism with the rest for manufacturing and processing. The concept of SEZs in Indonesia was only announced in 2014 when President Joko Widodo came to power. Buoyed by the success of the country’s free trade zones, SEZs were developed to further increase foreign investments into the country. As such, the first SEZs in Indonesia has only been in operation since 2015, with the majority only beginning operations in 2019.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/where-to-invest/an-introduction-to-special-economic-zones-in-indonesia)In establishing the SEZs, the government has sought to diversify away from the island of Java and spread across the country. As of 2021, Indonesia’s SEZs have attracted just over US$5 billion in investments and employed over 28,000 workers.
The SEZs serves as a hub for selected activities from logistics, to export processing activities, to tourism. They are designed in this way to maximize the ready availability of local resources and cater to upstream and downstream industries. For instance, the Arun Lhokseumawe SEZ, located in Aceh province, has its primary activities surrounding petrochemicals, oil and gas, and paper production. The province is known for its vast resources of oil and gas. The Mandalika SEZ, located on the scenic island of Lombok, is being pushed as an SEZ that supports eco-tourism and the agro-industry.
Further, the Kendal SEZ has its primary activities in manufacturing, particularly garment and textiles, automotive furniture, electronics, and food and beverages. The SEZ is found in Central Java province, one of Indonesia’s main manufacturing hubs.
Within an SEZ, the following business activities can be undertaken:
  1. Production and processing;
  2. Logistics and distribution;
  3. Research, digital economy, and technology development;
  4. Tourism;
  5. Energy development;
  6. Education;
  7. Healthcare;
  8. Sports;
  9. Financial services;
  10. Creative industries;
  11. SEZ development and management; and
  12. Procurement of SEZ infrastructure.


Investors operating in Indonesia’s SEZs will find they are supported by well-integrated infrastructure from highways, drainage systems, high-speed internet and communication systems, ports, and airports. Moreover, the Indonesian government has prepared an **array of fiscal and non-fiscal incentives in its special economic zones**⟨93⟩, such as an easier immigration process, corporate income tax reductions, and exemptions on import duties and excise duties, among many others.
For foreign investors, **entering Indonesia’s special economic zones**⟨94⟩ and taking full advantage of what they offer requires a long-term outlook. Companies must first ensure their industry is suited to the infrastructure and benefits afforded in the SEZs, as well as understand the long-term domestic and regional policies that could impact their industry.
![SEZ in Indonesia⟨95⟩](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SEZ-in-Indonesia.jpg)
## Diversifying away from Java
Indonesia’s special economic zones are located across the vast archipelago with the aim of stimulating equal economic growth. Until the year 2000, centralization and economic development policies were centered on Java and the country’s capital, Jakarta (also located in Java).
![⟨96⟩](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Java.jpg)
Java is supported by a strong consumer base since the island accounts for approximately 60 percent of Indonesia’s total population — making it the most populated island in the world (with over 141 million people). This also means Java accounts for 60 percent of the country’s GDP. Further, Java has the most developed services sector in Indonesia and more than half of the country’s 100 or so industrial estates are located on the island.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/where-to-invest/an-introduction-to-special-economic-zones-in-indonesia)After Java, the biggest contributor to Indonesia’s GDP was the island of Sumatra (approx. 21 percent), followed by Kalimantan and Sulawesi (eight and six percent), respectively. Bali and Nusa Tenggara contributed three percent to the GDP while Maluku and Papua, the remaining two percent. The majority of Indonesia’s manufacturing sector is also located in Java, with West Java province accounting for 60 percent of the country’s manufacturing activities.
The main drag on national growth has come from the provinces outside of Java as they are heavily reliant on commodities processing and extractive industries, such as oil and gas, nickel, tin, palm oil, and coal.
This overreliance on commodities means that these provinces are susceptible to global price shocks, such as when the government began banning the export of unprocessed commodities in 2014, and when commodity prices declined at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, supporting businesses related to commodities extraction, such as transport, were also impacted.
Since entering office, President Joko Widodo and his government have emphasized a regional development strategy with a focus on investing in roads, ports, railways, and power plants; spearheaded by the development of special economic zones. In his second term, the President plans to spend more than US$400 billion until 2024 on a variety of infrastructure projects that will help to integrate the country more effectively.
The development of SEZs can also stimulate regional administrations to take measures to improve the local business environment, such as by reducing corruption and improving healthcare and education. These are important steps that can support long-term growth.
How the government implements its infrastructure plans and SEZ development will be vital in not only reducing the economic dependency on Java but also helping Indonesia shift from exporting raw materials to that processed goods.
## Indonesia’s fourth industrial revolution
The development of Indonesia’s special economic zones will be vital in pushing the country’s 4.0 industrial revolution (4IR) roadmap. The 4IR roadmap, also dubbed ‘Making Indonesia 4.0’, was first touted by President Joko Widodo in 2018 and lays out the government’s plans to transform the country’s manufacturing sector to a higher-value future with the capacity to add some 10 million new jobs. The industry contributed the largest to the national GDP, at 17.34 percent (in 2021).
The Making Indonesia 4.0 roadmap focuses on five key sub-sectors of manufacturing. These are:
  1. Food and beverage – to be an F&B powerhouse in ASEAN;
  2. Textile and apparel – to be a leading producer of functional clothing;
  3. Automotive – to become a leader in the export of internal combustion engine vehicles and electric vehicles;
  4. Chemicals – to become a leader in biochemical manufacturing; and
  5. Electronics – to nurture domestic industries to be globally competitive.


These five sectors account for 60 percent of the country’s GDP, and 65 percent of total exports, and employ some 60 percent of Indonesia’s workforce.
Through Making Indonesia 4.0, the government hopes to improve its net export-to-GDP from one percent to 10 percent by 2030 and increase the manufacturing sector’s contribution to GDP to 25 percent by the same year.
In addition to the five focus sectors, there are 10 national priorities for achieving the goals of industry 4.0. These are:
  1. Reform material flow to enhance domestic upstream production.
  2. Attract foreign manufacturers to incorporate in Indonesia and accelerate technology transfer.
  3. Redesign industrial zones to develop a single nationwide industry zoning roadmap.
  4. Encourage sustainability to explore opportunities in sustainable industries, such as renewables.
  5. Empower some 3.7 million SMEs by embracing digitization and technology. This is crucial since 62 percent of the workforce is employed in micro or small enterprises, which often have low productivity rates.
  6. Building a nationwide digital infrastructure to advance the national network and build digital platforms, such as 5G technology and data centers.
  7. Developing human capital for preparing Indonesian talent that is compatible with the industry 4.0 era. The country has the world’s fourth-largest working population; however, the majority are considered unskilled.
  8. Regulation and policy reforms to build more coherent policies.
  9. Establish an innovative ecosystem to enhance research and development initiatives by the public and private sector, and higher education institutions. Indonesia currently spends only 0.1 to 0.3 percent on R&D.
  10. Incentivize investments in technology to provide an array of incentives, such as tax exemptions and subsidies for local businesses that are adopting new technology in their operations.


![Indonesia 4IR⟨97⟩](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Indonesia-4IR.jpg)
Compared to other ASEAN states, Indonesia, along with the Philippines, Cambodia, and Vietnam, are still in the planning phase of their 4IR strategies. Singapore leads the bloc in 4IR adoption, which is focused on reskilling its workforce and transforming its industries. Singapore will invest over S$3 billion (US$2.1 billion) in manufacturing and engineering to this end.

# Transfer pricing and Advance Pricing Agreements in Indonesia 
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/taxation-and-accounting/international-taxation)
## Transfer pricing
Transfer pricing in Indonesia is regulated under the Income Tax Law of 2008, which authorizes a tax officer to re-determine the tax income of a taxpayer who has a ‘special relationship’ with other taxpayers.
  

Contributing Advisor
Transfer pricing applies to companies that transact between companies from the same group, such as a subsidiary, or other ‘related’ parties. The individuals or entities are related if:
  * One party has direct or indirect control of the other (e.g., head offices or branch offices); or
  * Both parties are under the control of the same persons or entity (e.g., several subsidiaries being owned by the same parent company).


Such conditions can give rise to preferential pricing between the parties, which could lead to the hiding of profits and underpaying taxes.

Under the Income Tax Law, a special relationship is deemed to exist if:
  * The taxpayer owns capital participation either directly or indirectly of at least 25 percent of another taxpayer;
  * The relationship between taxpayers through ownership of at least 25 percent of two or more taxpayers;
  * A family relationship through marriage or blood; or
  * The participation in management or technology even if there is no ownership.


### The arm’s length principle
The arm’s length principle is accepted in Indonesia as the standard guide to transfer pricing. Under this principle, profits are taxed on where the profits are generated and where the real economic activities have occurred.
### What are the required documents?
The three-tiered system to transfer pricing documentation consists of the following documents:
  * A master file, that consists of the standardized information related to the business group; 
    * Structure and ownership of each member of the group;
    * Any intangible assets owned by the group;
    * The business activities of the group; and
    * Consolidated financial statements;
  * A local file, that consists of information specifically related to the transactions of the local taxpayer; 
    * Business identity and activities of the taxpayer;
    * The related party transaction information;
    * Determination of the arm’s length principle; and
    * The taxpayers’ financial information; and
  * A country-by-country report (CbC), which relates to the global allocation of the group’s income and taxes.


Master and local file documentation obligations are imposed on taxpayers who, apart from having related-party transactions, must meet the following criteria:
  * Have gross revenue of more than 50 billion rupiah (US$3.4 million) for the previous fiscal year;
  * Taxpayers that conduct related-party transactions exceeding 20 billion rupiah (US$1.37 million) in the previous fiscal year;
  * Taxpayers that conduct related-party transactions exceeding five billion rupiah (US$344,000) pertaining to services, interest payments, or intangible goods; or
  * Taxpayers that conduct transactions with related parties located in a jurisdiction with a lower income tax rate than Indonesia.


The CbC reporting obligations are imposed on taxpayers that fulfill the following criteria:
  * Taxpayers that are not parent entities but are members of entities of a group with an ultimate parent entity that is a tax resident in a country that; 
    * Does not have an exchange of information agreement with Indonesia;
    * Does not make CbC reports available to the Indonesian tax authorities; or
    * Do not impose obligations to file CbC reports.

### Transfer pricing methods
There are five transfer pricing methods for tangible or intangible transactions in Indonesia. These are:
  * The comparable uncontrolled price (CUP) method;
  * The cost-plus method;
  * The resale price method;
  * The profit split method; and
  * The transactional net margin method (TNMM).


The CUP method is the most favored method used by Indonesia’s Directorate General of Taxes (DGT), such as for royalty and interest payments. If the CUP method is not applicable, then the Indonesian tax authorities will apply the TNMM method.
## Advance pricing agreement
An Indonesian taxpayer can submit the advance pricing agreement (APA) through a tax office where the taxpayer is registered based on:
  * The initiative from the taxpayer through a unilateral or bilateral APA; or
  * A written application submitted to the DGA for a bilateral APA from an overseas taxpayer.


Did You Know
An APA is an agreement between one or more taxpayers and one or more tax authorities to determine in advance a set of criteria, and within a specific period, for specific cross-border transactions. This is to ensure such transactions comply with the arm’s length principle as well as assist in avoiding transfer pricing disputes.
### APA application withdrawal and renewal
Taxpayers can withdraw from an APA application before the APA negotiation has been completed. A taxpayer, however, can submit an APA renewal application to the DGT within 12 months and up to six months before the last fiscal year.

# City Spotlight: Investing in Jakarta
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/where-to-invest/city-spotlight-investing-in-jakarta)
Located on the northwest coast of Java, Jakarta is the capital of Indonesia and the largest city in the country. Strategically located in the archipelago, Jakarta serves as the gateway to the rest of the country. The city is a special territory holding the status of a province, and consisting of Greater Jakarta, which covers an area of 637.44 square kilometers.
With a population of almost 10 million, the city is the political, economic, and cultural center of Indonesia. Jakarta serves as a melting pot for the country’s diverse range of ethnic groups, over 300.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/where-to-invest/city-spotlight-investing-in-jakarta)The average worker’s salary is US$240 per month and there is a mandatory welfare contribution of 4.8 percent of the employee’s total salary. However, steep wage increases are often common, particularly due to the country's increasingly powerful trade unions.
Despite being a modern city in many ways, Jakarta’s infrastructure system still leaves much to be desired. Traffic jams can be extensive, particularly in the business district. Further complicating matters, public transportation is still quite poor since the government has mainly focused on adding more roads.
## SME assistance
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) make up almost half of Indonesia’s GDP. Due to their importance, the country’s government is keen to help grow and support these businesses. As a result, the government is currently developing a series of pilot projects aimed at developing SMEs in Indonesia; these projects are likely to be long-term. 
An additional area of support for SMEs in Indonesia comes from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which has been working in Indonesia for some time now. According to its website, the IFC works to improve access to finance by investing in commercial banks and aiding them in the provision of loans to micro, small, and medium enterprises.
According to the IFC, the organization “helps companies to increase their business productivity and bottom line by adopting global best practices. Our involvement in manufacturing and services industry helps Indonesian companies meet local demand and enter international markets. Our corporate governance program provides advice to companies to be more competitive and attract local and foreign capital by improving the transparency of their business operations.”
Additionally, the IFC is working to improve the quality of Indonesia’s infrastructure through targeted investments in transportation, power plants, telecoms, ports, and other projects.
## **Key business sectors and industries  
**
Like the country as a whole, Jakarta’s economy is made up of a range of sectors and industries. Indonesia’s workers are often highly skilled and low cost, making the country an attractive destination for foreign investment. The key economic sectors of Jakarta include the following:
  * Banking
  * Trading
  * Financial services
  * Manufacturing
  * Services


The cities top industrial sectors include the following:
  * Automotive
  * Electronics
  * Mechanical engineering
  * Chemicals
  * Biomedical sciences manufacturing


Additionally, Jakarta has a very attractive luxury property investment sector. In fact, Knight Frank, a global real estate consultancy, reported that, in 2013, Jakarta offered the highest return on high-end property investment in the world.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/where-to-invest/city-spotlight-investing-in-jakarta)Jakarta is also considered a key shopping destination in both Indonesia and in Southeast Asia. Another area of interest is e-commerce. Illustrating the rise of e-commerce in Indonesia, annual online sales are forecast to grow from US$1 billion-$3 billion in 2014 and reach US$10 billion by the end of 2015. With its population of nearly 10 million and relatively well-developed network infrastructure, the capital, Jakarta, has led initial growth in this market; recently, however, orders from outside the country’s capital have begun to swell, hinting at big opportunities for growth in second and third-tier cities.
## **Industrial and economic zones**
Some of the industrial and economic zones in and around Jakarta include the East Jakarta Industrial Area (EJIA), which has successfully grown into one of the biggest industrial clusters in Indonesia. Additionally, there is the Jakarta Bay Industrial Zone (JBIZ). There are also a number of industrial areas located in Bekasi, located on Jakarta’s eastern border. In addition to serving as a factory town for Jakarta, Bekasi also provides numerous workers who commute to the city center everyday.
The city is also home to the Port of Jakarta (Tanjung Priok Port). The port is the country’s largest seaport, with an annual traffic capacity of around 45 million tons of cargo and 4,000,000 TEU's.
## **Conclusion**
Jakarta is one of the most industrialized and business-friendly areas in Indonesia. If the city can continue to improve its infrastructure and business regulations, growth seems assured for this dynamic Southeast Asian city.

Non-resident suppliers of digital services within Indonesia can now be appointed as VAT collectors. As such, are now required to collect 11 percent VAT and pay to the Indonesian government.
  

Contributing Advisor
The following utilization of intangible goods will now be subject to VAT:
  * The use of or right to exercise the copyright in the field of literature, art or scientific work, patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark, or other forms of intellectual property right, industrial property right, or other similar rights;
  * The utilization or right to use industrial, commercial, or scientific tools/equipment;
  * Utilization of knowledge or information obtained from the scientific, technical, industrial, or commercial sectors;
  * The use of additional or complementary assistance in the utilization or right to exercise the right as referred to in point (1), the utilization or right to use the tools/equipment as referred to in point (2), or provision of knowledge or information as referred to in point (3);

  * **Merchants (sellers):** Businesses or individuals that conduct electronic offerings through electronic systems either managed or owned by themselves or through an e-commerce organizer.
  * **E-commerce organizers (PPMSE):** Businesses or individuals that provide electronic systems to facilitate e-commerce transactions. These include business models, such as online streaming platforms, online marketplaces, online classified advertisements, and price comparison platforms, among others.
  * **Intermediary Service Organizers (PSP):** These are businesses or individuals that provide search system facilities (for example, Google, Bing) or those that provide information storage services (hosting and caching).


The aforementioned entities can be either domestic or foreign businesses and the legal requirements for each type will also differ.

#### Domestic e-commerce organizers
Businesses that operate their own e-commerce facilities are classified as PPMSEs and must obtain a special license named _Surat Izin Usaha Perdagangan melalui Sistem Elektronik_(business license for trading through an electronic system (SIUPMSE).
The SIUPMSE can be applied through the OSS system and businesses will need to adhere to certain criteria to be eligible. These are:
  * Obtaining an Electronic System Provider certificate within 14 days after the SIUPMSE is issued;
  * Must provide a website and/or application name to the government;
  * Must establish a consumer complaints section on their website/application, which includes an e-mail address and contact number in addition to the details of the Directorate-General of Consumer Protection and Trade Compliance;
  * The PPMSE must provide facilities that inform or link customers to the OSS Agency’s website; and
  * The business must submit its transaction data (subscribers, payments, complaints, contracts, shipments etc.) to Statistics Indonesia (BPS), the government agency responsible for conducting statistical surveys.


### Foreign merchants
Foreign merchants must provide a valid business license issued in the country where they are established to the domestic PPSME company which provides their electronic communication facilities. The domestic PPSME will then need to report all the transactional activities (subscribers, payments, complaints, contracts, shipments, etc.) of the foreign merchant to the BPS.
#### Foreign e-commerce organizers
Foreign PPSMEs that have been appointed as ‘VAT collectors’ by the Ministry of Finance are obligated to charge the 11 percent VAT rate on the sales of digital products to Indonesian consumers.
They must first have local transaction values of the following:
  * The PPSME has completed transactions with Indonesian consumers that exceed 600 million rupiahs (US$38,687) in a year or 50 million rupiahs (US$3,224) per month; or
  * Traffic or visitors to the e-commerce site exceeds 12,000 users per year or 1,000 users per month.

## Stamp duty
Individuals, companies, and other organizations in Indonesia must pay stamp duties on certain legal documents. The standard stamp duty tax rate is 10,000 rupiah (US$0.64).
Important Tip
Indonesia requires stamp duties on two main types of documents: documents created to explain events of a civil nature and documents to be used as evidence in a court of law.
Documents of a civil nature include the following:
  * Agreements, certificates, statement letters, and similar documents and their copies;
  * Notarial deeds and executorial deeds (_grosse_) and their copies;
  * Deeds made before a land deed officer (also known as a land conveyance officer) and their copies;
  * Securities in any form and name; and
  * Documents stating a sum of money above 5,000,000 rupiah (US$321), describe the receipt of money or contain an acknowledgment of debt payment or settlement, either entirely or partially.


In addition to these documents, the Law also applies to the following civil documents:
  * Securities transaction documents, including futures contract transactions in any name or form;
  * Auction documents in the form of excerpts, minutes, copies, and minutes of auction executorial deeds (_grosse_); and
  * Other documents stipulated by Government Regulation.


The Law exempts the following documents from stamp duty:
  * Land transfer and building rights documents used for handling and restoring social conditions following natural disasters;
  * Land transfer and building rights documents used solely for religious or non-commercial activities;
  * Documents relating to the implementation of government programs and monetary or financial policies; and
  * Documents relating to the implementation of international agreements under binding international treaties or reciprocal laws.


### Electronic stamp duty
Electronic stamps, which carry a unique code and description, apply to electronic transaction documents with a value above 5,000,000 rupiah (US$321).
The Indonesian government, however, is still building the infrastructure to manage electronic stamp duties.

# Indonesia Considers an SEZ on Natuna: Investment Prospects, Challenges
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/where-to-invest/indonesia-considers-an-sez-on-natuna-investment-prospects-challenges)
**_The Indonesian government is mulling the prospect of turning the Natuna Regency into a special economic zone._**
**_The natural features and resources of the Natuna Regency give it considerable potential for tourism and energy development, as well as fishing. The regency has one of the world’s largest sources of untapped gas._**
* * *
The Indonesian government may turn the Natuna Regency into a special economic zone (SEZ) in a bid to attract investment and strengthen regional security. The decision to turn the Natuna Regency into an SEZ is 
Indonesia currently has 12 SEZs in operation and seven more under construction, for a total of 19. SEZs provide attractive conditions to investors by offering incentives, tax breaks, high-quality infrastructure, and industry clustering.
While the transformation of the Natuna Regency into an SEZ would introduce similar incentives, businesses considering operating in the region must grapple with heightened political risks stemming from its involvement in territorial disputes.
## The appeal of Natuna Regency for investors
The Natuna Regency, also known as the Natuna Islands, is a collection of about 154 islands in Indonesia’s Riau Islands province, 27 of which are inhabited. The islands fall between the Malaysian Peninsula to the west and Borneo to the east.
The population of the Natuna Regency is fairly small, with just over 80,000 residents, according to the 
The natural features and resources of the Natuna Regency give it considerable potential for tourism and energy development, as well as fishing. The Natuna Regency has at least 
Much of the natural gas currently sourced from the Natuna Regency is exported to neighboring Singapore and Malaysia. One of Singapore’s 
Fishing and tourism are other key industries in the Natuna Regency. However, both these industries suffer from infrastructure gaps. For instance, the fishing industry lacks processing facilities to add value to local fishing, while the tourism industry suffers from poor connectivity and transportation.
## Political risks of investing in the area
The Natuna Islands are at the forefront of territorial disputes between Indonesia and China – a factor that greatly increases the political risks of investing in the region. Indonesia claims the Natuna Islands as falling within its 200 nautical miles exclusive economic zone (EEZ), while China claims the islands under its “nine-dash line” historic rights claim.
In 2021, the Chinese government 
Territorial disputes surrounding the Natuna Islands do not just occur in political statements. Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese vessels have 
## How to read the government’s plans to develop Natuna Regency
The possibility of an SEZ is not the only initiative to further develop the Natuna Regency. Earlier plans launched by the Indonesian government have shown the increased importance it is placing in the Natuna Regency, setting the stage for its possible SEZ designation.
In March 2022, President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) issued _._ The decree sets out six different designations for zones in the Natuna Islands, each with a focus on a particular area, such as tourism, fishing, oil, and gas, or security. For instance, the decree 
The decree also pledged to build a new military base in the Natuna Regency. The government will be allowed to carry out military and coast guard drills in designated security zones.
Both the possible SEZ and the presidential decree combined indicate plans for an increased military presence in the area alongside economic development. A larger military presence may give investors greater confidence in securing their assets, but at the same time risks provoking tensions between Indonesia and its neighbors.
Earlier, in 2018, the Indonesian government 
## Key considerations for foreign stakeholders
The transformation of the Natuna Regency into an SEZ, if passed, stands to create opportunities for foreign investors in the tourism, fishing, energy, and security sectors.
Any investment in the Natuna Regency, however, must factor political risks into the equation.
For example, in the tourism sector, a diplomatic standoff between the Indonesian and Chinese governments could lead to boycotts from Chinese tourists or bans on their ability to book tours in the area. In 2017, the Chinese government 
The risks are not just limited to tourism.
Competing claims over rights to oil and gas drilling are a central component of the territorial disputes between the Indonesian and Chinese governments. A new crisis and the potential worsening of a dispute could directly involve an energy project in the region, putting investments in the sector at significant risk.
While investment in the Natuna Islands carries risks, the region’s importance to the Indonesian government also offers opportunities.
From building a new military base to potentially setting up an SEZ, the Indonesian government is investing heavily in the Natuna Islands and is seemingly committed to its success.
For businesses already interested in investing in the Natuna Islands but put off by infrastructural deficits and logistics costs, the possibility of an SEZ is welcome news. This may especially be the case in the tourism industry, which would greatly benefit from increased domestic and international connectivity, as well as improved transportation within the Natuna Regency itself.
The Indonesian government’s plans for a Natuna Islands SEZ will likely become clearer in the coming months. If announced, additional news on the SEZ’s incentives, features, and timelines stand to follow.

# Indonesia Issues Incentives for New Capital City Project
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/where-to-invest/indonesia-issues-incentives-for-new-capital-city-project)
**_Indonesia has issued various incentives to attract investments into its new capital city project. The incentives range from income tax holidays to import tax exemptions as well as the permission for hiring foreign workers for up to 10 years._**
* * *
Indonesia’s government recently issued Government Regulation 12 of 2023 (GR 9/2023), which offers various fiscal and non-fiscal incentives to businesses seeking to invest in **Indonesia’s new capital city, Nusantara**⟨93⟩.
The incentives afforded to investors include corporate income tax exemptions, tax holidays, and personal income tax exemptions for investments in priority projects in the new capital, such as ports, airports, renewable energy systems, and healthcare services, among many others.
Nusantara is estimated to cost US$35 billion to construct and the central government is expected to begin operations in the new city in 2024. Public funds would only be used for 20 percent of the project with the remainder from foreign investors. The government is expecting the presidential palace to be finished in time for the country’s Independence Day anniversary on August 17.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/where-to-invest/indonesia-issues-incentives-for-new-capital-city-project)President Joko Widodo has assembled a team of political and business-heavyweights as part of the new capital’s steering committee. These include Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Zayed Al Nahyan and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
The new capital sits on a 632,000-acre site, which is roughly four times the size of the current capital, Jakarta. The project presents ample opportunities for foreign investors in a variety of sectors ranging from infrastructure to manufacturing to healthcare and education.
## Income tax reductions and holidays
The government will provide income tax holidays and reductions for investments in Indonesia’s new capital city. Further, the government will issue future implementing regulations on how the tax facilities will be regulated.
The government will provide up to 100 percent corporate income tax exemption of between 10 and 30 years for domestic taxpayers that invest at least 10 billion rupiah (US$650,745) in the new capital. The duration of the incentive depends on the sectors in which the investment is directed.
For instance, investing in public services will receive the longest tax holiday up until 2035. Banks and insurers that invest before 2035 can enjoy up to 25 years of income tax exemption whereas those that invest before 2045 can receive up to 20 years of income tax exemption.
Developers of other critical infrastructure, such as public works, airports, seaports, and housing, can also benefit from the incentives, as well as businesses that engage in economic development through the construction of hotels, malls, energy infrastructure, and software, among many others.
Corporate income tax reductions will be available for investors that develop financial centers in the new capital, as well as for companies that relocate their head offices to the new capital. Moreover, investors that implement certain research and development activities will be afforded a reduction in their gross income.
Further, micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in certain business activities will also pay a zero percent corporate income tax rate.
## Utilization of foreign workers
Businesses operating in the new capital city will be allowed to employ foreign workers for a period of 10 years; this can also be extended. The foreign worker can also secure residency permits for 10 years, which is also extendable depending on their employment contract.
The employer is also exempted from paying the Foreign Worker Compensation Fund, which is the amount of US$100 paid every month to the Ministry of Manpower.
The residency permits of foreign workers who hold management positions in companies operating in the new capital will remain valid as long as they retain that said position.
## Land rights
The government is offering investors 95-year land use permits, which can be extended for another 95 years and thus totaling 190 years for land use.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/where-to-invest/indonesia-issues-incentives-for-new-capital-city-project)There will be two categories of land in Indonesia’s new capital: a) state-owned property that will be managed by the Nusantara Capital City Authority (a special agency tasked with governing and managing the new capital city) and b) assets that have been granted to the capital city authority through the right-to-manage (_Hak Pengelolaan – HPL_) deed titles.
The capital city authority can allocate these HPL lands to businesses for the following land rights/titles:
  * Right to cultivate (_Hak Guna Usaha_ – HGU);
  * Right to build (_Hak Guna Bangunan –_ HGB); and
  * Right to use (_Hak Pakai – HP_).


The **right to cultivate** **title (HGU)** gives the user the right to work/cultivate the land for a specific period. This type of land title is usually granted for agricultural activities, such as plantations. In Indonesia’s new capital, holders of the HGU title will be allowed to cultivate the land for 95 years, which can then be extended for another 95 years, totaling 190 years.
This is a huge increase compared to other parts of Indonesia where the HGU title is valid for 35 years and extendable for another 35 years upon expiration.
The **right to build title (HGB)** is granted to Indonesian citizens and foreign companies for the purpose of erecting a building on the land. HGB title holders will be eligible to hold the title for 80 years, which can be extended for another 80 years, totaling 160 years.
Outside of Nusantara, HGB title holders can only hold the title for 30 years, and extendable for 20 years. Once this period has expired, the title can be renewed for another 30 years, so 80 years in total.
Finally, **right-to-use (HP) title** holders will also be given 80 years and extendable for another 80 years. This title refers to the right to use or harvest the land owned by the state or private persons.
Outside of the new capital city, the HP title is granted for 25 years and extended for another 20 years, before a final renewal of 25 years, totaling 70 years.
## Customs
The government offers exemptions on import duties for the import of goods used for the construction and development of Indonesia’s new capital. Further, there is import duty exemptions for the import of goods and materials used in the construction and development of industries within the new capital.

# Choosing the Ideal Investment Location in Indonesia’s Special Economic Zones
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/where-to-invest/choosing-the-ideal-investment-location-in-indonesia-s-special-economic-zones)
**_For foreign investors, entering Indonesia’s special economic zones (SEZ) and taking full advantage of what they offer requires a long-term outlook. Companies must first ensure their industry is suited to the infrastructure and benefits afforded in the SEZs and understand the long-term domestic and regional policies that could impact their industry._**
* * *
## A priority policy
Indonesia’s government has made the development of the country’s special economic zones (SEZ) a priority policy with the aim of attracting over US$50 billion in foreign investment over the next decade, particularly for SEZ-oriented manufacturing.
As of 2022, there are 19 **SEZs in Indonesia**⟨93⟩ of which 12 are in operation and the remainder are in the construction phase. Eight are designated for tourism with the rest for manufacturing and processing.
![⟨94⟩](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MicrosoftTeams-image-5.jpg)
The concept of SEZs in Indonesia was only announced in 2014 when President Joko Widodo came to power. Buoyed by the success of the country’s free trade zones, SEZs were developed to increase foreign investments into the country further. As such, the first SEZs in Indonesia has only been in operation since 2015, with the majority only beginning operations in 2019.
Indonesia’s SEZs have been designed to maximize the surrounding resources. Companies looking to incorporate into the country’s SEZs must select their location strategically based on the available infrastructure and natural resources, particularly since most of the country’s SEZs only began operations in 2019.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/where-to-invest/choosing-the-ideal-investment-location-in-indonesia-s-special-economic-zones)Moreover, foreign investors need to be aware of the Indonesian government’s development plans, which often determine which industries receive the most support and incentives. In establishing the SEZs, the government has sought to diversify away from the island of Java and spread across the country. As of 2021, Indonesia’s SEZs have attracted just over US$5 billion in investments and employed over 28,000 workers.
Having this long-term outlook will allow foreign businesses to be rewarded by Indonesia’s unique advantages, such as its competitive labor costs, huge domestic market, and the potential expansion of land in the SEZs – an issue that has constrained businesses in other ASEAN markets like Malaysia and Singapore.
We highlight some of the specializations of Indonesia’s SEZs below.
## Nongsa SEZ
Indonesia is set to open two new SEZs on Batam after President Joko Widodo recently approved the decision, which includes the Nongsa Digital Park. The digital park will focus on research and development, education, and creative industries, along with its existing focus on technology and tourism. The park originally opened in 2018 after bilateral discussions between Indonesia and Singapore to develop an ‘IT hub and digital bridge’ between the two countries. Currently, the park’s 155.43 hectares of land is home to over 100 technology companies, mostly from Singapore.
As an SEZ, the park aims to attract more international investors, beyond the largely Singapore-based contingent currently active in the area. Its goal is to receive 16 trillion rupiah (US$1.1 billion) in investments and to create 16,500 new jobs. To reach this target, the park hopes to become a hub for data centers, an industry the market research firm Technavio projects will grow by US$10.57 billion between 2019 and 2023 in Southeast Asia.
**Seminar- Diversifying China Production and Sourcing Into Southeast Asia and India**
**11:30am - 2pm CDT**
_June 16, 2023 | Southeast Asia and India are two of the fastest-growing regions in the world and many businesses are considering or have already relocated parts of their supply chains to these two regions to lower costs and diversify._
Join us in this seminar!
The park will be at the forefront of Indonesia’s booming digital economy, which according to a report by Google, Temasek, and Bain & Company, will have a gross merchandise value (GMV) of US$146 billion by 2025 – the largest in ASEAN. This growth will be primarily driven by e-commerce, which is expected to have a GMV of US$104 billion by the same year.
The island of Batam has been a free trade zone since 2009, along with the neighboring Bintan and Karimun islands, and its first SEZs were set up in 2017. Together, the three islands are known as the BBK free trade zone.
Due to its proximity to Singapore (only 20km away), some 70 percent of Batam’s foreign investors are from Singapore, who use the island as an alternative manufacturing hub. According to the Badan Pengusahaan Batam (BP Batam), the local investment and development authority, Singaporean companies have contributed some 42 percent of the US$2.5 billion of foreign investment that Batam has received between 2015 to 2020. The island produces goods ranging from computer chips to precast concrete and is home to multinational companies such as Caterpillar, Ciba Vision, and Schneider Electric.
![Nongsa-SEZ⟨95⟩](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Nongsa-SEZ.jpg)
## Batam Aero Technic SEZ
Batam Aero Technic (BAT) is the other new SEZ declared by President Joko Widodo alongside the Nongso Digital Park. With the upgraded SEZ status, Batam Aero Technic plans to expand from maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) of passenger aircraft to logistics and distribution, production and processing, and technology development.
BAT hopes to capture the US$1 billion that local airlines spend on MRO and the US$100 billion that airlines in the Asia pacific will spend by 2025.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/where-to-invest/choosing-the-ideal-investment-location-in-indonesia-s-special-economic-zones)Other supporting industries currently being developed in the SEZ are in the form of logistics, such as the warehousing of equipment and components. Further, BAT aims to manufacture cabin items from head racks to galleys, airplane lavatories, airplane seats, carpets, and head rests.
The 30-hectare facility is owned by Lion Air Group, the holding company that owns Indonesia’s largest private airline, Lion Air. In 2013, the airline made the largest-ever single order of Airbus A320 planes at 234, valued at US$22.4 billion.
Batam Aero Technic aims to receive 7.2 trillion rupiah (US$500 million) in investments and to create close to 10,000 new jobs with the upgrade to SEZ status. Indonesia is the second-fastest-growing aviation industry in the world after China, and the country’s air passenger market is expected to become the fourth largest in the world by 2039.
![Batam-Aero-Technic-SEZ.jpg⟨96⟩](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Batam-Aero-Technic-SEZ.jpg)
## Sei Mangkei SEZ
Sei Mangkei SEZ has exported over 26 trillion rupiah (US$1.7 billion) worth of goods since its establishment in 2015, mainly for palm oil and palm oil products. The North Sumatra Province is one of the leading palm oil-producing regions in the country.
PT Unilever Oleochemical Indonesia (PT UOI) – a subsidiary of multinational consumer goods company Unilever — is the largest tenant in Sei Mangkei SEZ with the company operating on 27 hectares of land, producing a variety of by-products of palm oil refining, such as soap noodles, surfactants, fatty acids, and glycerin, which are raw materials needed for household goods like detergents. The company also invested a further US$150 million in 2021 to expand its operations in the SEZ, and once completed, PT UOI will have the largest palm oil processing facility in Sei Mangkei SEZ. Further, Sei Mangkei aims to have the largest integrated facility for palm oil processing.
Palm oil is by far the most consumed and traded edible oil in the world. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, 77 million tons of palm oil are expected to be produced this year – with Indonesia accounting for around 60 percent of the global supply share. Malaysia ranks second with a 25 percent supply share.
Grown only in the tropics, the oil palm tree produces a high-quality oil that is used as a common ingredient in cosmetic and household items, such as detergents, margarine, soaps, chocolates, cakes, cleaning products, and biofuels, among others.
The Indonesian government is also planning to develop a railway from the Sei Mangkei SEZ to Kuala Tanjung port. Currently, trucks from the SEZ transport goods to the port some 50km or so by road. The port has a current capacity of 600,000 twenty-foot-equivalents (TEUs) but this is expected to be upgraded to handle over 12 million TEUs by 2039.
![Sei-Mangkei-SEZ⟨97⟩](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/news/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sei-Mangkei-SEZ.jpg)
## Kendal SEZ
The Kendal SEZ was only given SEZ status in 2019 but has managed to attract over 70 businesses from Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, South Korea, and China.
Before being upgraded as an SEZ, Kendal was an industrial park; in fact, it is the only industrial park on Java island that has been given SEZ status.
The Kendal SEZ is designated for export-oriented manufacturing ranging from automotives to electronics to textiles and fashion. Out of the 66 tenants that have been established in the Kendal SEZ, 16 are fully operational with the remaining in the construction phase. PT MasterKidz Indonesia, a subsidiary of Hong Kong toy manufacturer MasterKidz, is one of those in full operations and has committed to invest over 400 billion rupiah (US$26.5 million), one of the largest investments in the SEZ. Another company, textile manufacturer, Dae Young Textile, has committed to invest 81 billion rupiah (US$5.3 million). Meanwhile, PT Sasakura Indonesia, a joint venture between Japanese engineering firm Sasakura Engineering Co., Ltd. and Indonesian engineering firm PT Wasamitra Engineering, has committed to invest 350 billion rupiah (US$23.2 million) to engage in steel fabrication activities.
The government has projected that the Kendal SEZ will attract 72 trillion rupiah (US$4.7 billion) by 2025, employing a workforce of 20,000 people.
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/where-to-invest/choosing-the-ideal-investment-location-in-indonesia-s-special-economic-zones)Central Java Province is being pushed as one of Indonesia’s manufacturing hubs. 30 percent of the country’s manufacturing activities are already located in this province, mainly for labor-intensive industries, such as textile production, attracting some of the largest apparel companies in the world like Nike, Uniqlo, and Adidas. The province saw US$980 million in foreign investments between January and September 2021.
As wages continue to increase in Jakarta, a growing number of foreign businesses see the opportunity to tap into the more cost-effective workforce in Central Java, which has a population of 34 million – larger than the whole of Malaysia — and a provincial minimum wage of US$119 per month. The province is also supported by 11 seaports, four international airports, and more than six industrial estates.

# Corporate Income Tax in Indonesia
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/taxation-and-accounting/corporate-income-tax-in-indonesia)
## Tax rate 
Indonesia’s corporate income tax rate is set at 22 percent for the 2023 fiscal year.
  

Contributing Advisor
Entities that pay corporate income tax in Indonesia can receive certain facilities based on established conditions:
  * Companies that are listed on the stock exchange that offer the minimum requirement of 40 percent of total share capital are subjected to a three percent tax cut from the standard rate;
  * Companies that have an annual turnover of 50 billion rupiah (US$3.5 million) are eligible for a 50 percent tax cut from the standard rate, which is imposed proportionally on the part of the gross turnover of up to 4.8 billion rupiah (US$336,000); and
  * Companies with gross turnover of no more than 4.8 billion rupiah (US$336,000) are subject to a 0.5 percent tax on total turnover.


## Tax residency
A company is treated as a resident in Indonesia if it is incorporated and conducts business in the country. A foreign company conducting business through a permanent establishment will be subject to the same tax rates as a resident company. A non-resident company is incorporated overseas but generates revenue from Indonesia.
## Tax payments and deadlines
Resident taxpayers must pay their tax liabilities either by direct payments, third party withholdings, or through a combination of both.
The deadline for the annual corporate tax payment is on the fourth month after the financial year-end. Furthermore, income tax returns must be filed by the end of the fourth month after the end of the company’s reported tax year.
Businesses in Indonesia commonly use the calender year as the tax year i.e., 1 January to 31 December. However, the tax year will follow the company’s financial year as declared in the article of association.
## Tax incentives
Companies that invest a certain amount in one of the 246 business lines that are deemed a ‘priority sector’⟨93⟩ by the government will be afforded fiscal and non-fiscal incentives.
Fiscal incentives include a 50 percent corporate income tax reduction for investments between 100 billion rupiah (US$6.6 million) and 500 billion rupiah (US$33.3 million) for a period of five years and 100 percent CIT reduction for investments over 500 billion rupiah (US$33.3 million) for a period between five and 20 years.
Did You Know
There are tax allowances available in the form of a 30 percent reduction in the taxable income on the total investment for six years, a special withholding tax rate on dividends of 10 percent, and tax losses carried forward for up to 10 years. 
Examples of Priority Business Sectors and Incentives  
---  
Business line |  Incentive type  
Textile and garment industry |  Tax allowance and investment allowance  
Pharmaceutical industry |  Tax allowance  
Digital economy (hosting, data processing etc.) |  Tax holiday  
Geothermal (exploring and drilling) |  Tax allowance  
Cooking palm oil industry |  Tax allowance  
Iron and steel industry |  Tax allowance  
Automotive industry |  Tax allowance  
Oil and gas refinery |  Tax holiday  
Cosmetics industry |  Tax allowance  
Coal gasification |  Tax allowance  
To classify as a priority sector, business enterprises must meet the following criteria:
  * Must be labor intensive; 
  * Must be capital intensive;
  * Must be part of a national project/program;
  * Must be export-oriented;
  * Must involve a pioneer industry (renewables, oil refining, metals, etc.);
  * Must utilize advanced technologies; and
  * Must implement research and development activities.

## Deductible expenses
As part of the CIT calculation, businesses must understand what deductible expenses they are entitled to. Business expenses related to the collecting, earning, and maintain of income are deductible.
These include:
  * Expenses related to business activities such as salary expenses, royalties, rent, and material expenses;
  * Promotion expenses such as for electronic and print media; and
  * Donations for charities, research and development initiatives, or educational facilities. However, the institution that receives the donation must be a registered taxpayer, the donation is documented, and should not be more than five percent of the previous year’s fiscal profit.


### What are considered disallowed deductions?
Disallowed deductions include:
  * Private expenses;
  * Income tax payments;
  * Tax penalties;
  * Employer contributions for health and life insurance unless these contributions are treated as part of the taxable income of the employees;
  * Non-business donations/gifts; and
  * Compensation received by partners in a partnership.

# Setting Up a Business in Nusantara, Indonesia: Investor Requirements, Tax Benefits
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/where-to-invest/setting-up-a-business-in-nusantara-indonesia-investor-requirements-tax-benefits)
**_We discuss Indonesia’s corporate establishment requirements and tax benefits for investors in Nusantara, the new capital city._**
  

Contributing Advisor
Indonesia’s government issued Government Regulation 12 of 2023 (GR 12/2023) on March 6, 2023, on the issuance of business licenses for investors looking to establish a presence⟨38⟩ in Nusantara, the country’s upcoming new capital city. The government hopes that GR 12/2023 can accelerate the development of the new capital city.
## What is Nusantara?
Nusantara is estimated to cost US$35 billion to construct and the central government is expected to begin operations in the new city in 2024.
Did You Know
The new capital city will be located in East Kalimantan province, on the island of Borneo.
Public funds would only be used for 20 percent of the project with the remainder from foreign investors. The government is expecting the presidential palace to be finished in time for the country’s Independence Day anniversary on August 17, 2024.
### How to obtain a business license in Nusantara
GR 12/2023 does not apply restrictions on limiting foreign capital ownership in certain business fields. However, the regulation does impose the type of sectors that can operate in Nusantara, as well as a requirement for foreign businesses to partner with micro, small, medium or cooperative businesses to obtain a business license.⟨42⟩
The sectors that are open for operation in Nusantara are the following:
  * Maritime affairs and fisheries;
  * Agriculture;
  * Environment and forestry;
  * Energy and mineral resources;
  * Nuclear;
  * Industries;
  * Trading;
  * Public works and public housing;
  * Transportation;
  * Health, medicine, and food;
  * Education and culture;
  * Tourism;
  * Religion;
  * Postal, telecommunications, broadcasting, and electronic systems and transactions;
  * Defense and security;
  * Employment;
  * Finance; and
  * Other sectors that are a priority are determined by the Head of the Authority.


The other requirements to obtain a business license include:
  * **The suitability of space for business activitie** s is authorized and organized by the Nusantara Capital City Authority. Therefore, businesses must showcase that their business plans can accommodate the spatial layout plan that is available in Nusantara.
  * **Environmental approvals** refer to an analysis of the environmental impact of the business activity on the new capital. If the business activities present a significant negative impact on the environment (in accordance with the provisions of laws and regulations on the environmental sector), the business must submit a detailed environmental management plan and a detailed environmental monitoring plan.
  * **Building approvals and certificates of ‘proper functions’** are given by the Nusantara Capital City Authority to businesses that have obtained spatial compatibility approval as well as environmental approval. Businesses can carry out construction in parallel while waiting for these approvals and the construction must be in accordance with the drawings submitted to the Nusantara Capital City Authority. Further, there is currently no fee for applying for building approvals.


After obtaining the documents mentioned above, businesses can apply for Nusantara business permits through the Online Single Submission (OSS) system. The Nusantara Capital Authority will then verify all the applications and mandatory documents as the basis for issuing business licenses.
## Employing foreign workers in Nusantara
Businesses operating in the new capital city will be allowed to employ foreign workers for a period of 10 years; this can also be extended. The foreign worker can also secure residency permits⟨63⟩ for 10 years, which is also extendable depending on their employment contract.

The employer is also exempted from paying the Foreign Worker Compensation Fund, which is the amount of US$100 paid every month to the Ministry of Manpower.
The residency permits of foreign workers who hold management positions in companies operating in the new capital will remain valid as long as they retain that said position.
If the period for the residence permit expires, it can be extended according to the terms of the work agreement⟨45⟩ between the business and the foreign worker.
## Other incentives
In addition to making it easier for businesses to hire foreign workers⟨46⟩, Indonesia has issued other incentives to attract investors to Nusantara⟨93⟩.
The government has offered up to 100 percent corporate income tax exemption for between 10 to 30 years for domestic taxpayers that invest at least IDR 10 billion (US$650,745). The duration of the incentive is dependent on the type of sector the business has invested.⟨17⟩ For instance, investing in public services will receive the longest tax holiday up until 2035. Banks⟨73⟩ and insurers that invest before 2035 can enjoy up to 25 years of income tax exemption whereas those that invest before 2045 can receive up to 20 years of income tax exemption.
Furthermore, the government is also offering 95-year land use permits for investors, which can be extended for another 95 years and thus totaling 190 years for land use.

# Tax Incentives for Businesses in Indonesia
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/taxation-and-accounting/tax-incentives-for-businesses)
Indonesia has enhanced and improved the incentives offered to businesses in a bid to spur foreign and domestic investments into the country. These incentives include long-term tax reductions for major investments, no import/excise duties, and a simplified immigration process. Indonesia’s government offers various fiscal and non-fiscal incentives to businesses seeking to invest in Indonesia’s new capital city, Nusantara.⟨93⟩

## Tax incentives for investments in priority sectors
Companies that invest a certain amount in one of the 246 prioritized business categories will receive fiscal and non-financial benefits.
Fiscal incentives include a 50 percent corporate income tax reduction for investments between 100 billion rupiah (US$6.6 million) and 500 billion rupiah (US$33.3 million) for a period of five years and a 100 percent CIT reduction for investments over 500 billion rupiah (US$33.3 million) for a period between five and 20 years.
Tax benefits include a 30 percent reduction in the taxable income on the total investment for six years, a special withholding tax rate on dividends of 10 percent, and tax losses carried forward for up to 10 years.

  * Must be export-oriented;
  * Must involve a pioneer industry (renewables, oil refining, metals, etc.);
  * Must utilize advanced technologies; and

## Tax allowance for investments in specific sectors and regions in Indonesia
There’s a variety of income tax incentives available for businesses investing in specific provinces (such as Aceh, Greater Jakarta⟨13⟩, and Riau) and industries, such as **marine and fisheries**⟨95⟩, pharmaceuticals, IT, and energy, among others, in the country.
These incentives come in the form of tax deductions, the accelerated depreciation of fixed tangible assets, and the accelerated amortization of intangible assets. The regulation also increases the period for fiscal loss compensation, in addition to setting the income tax rate on dividends for foreign taxpayers at 10 percent.
### Deduction in net income of the total investment
The government offers a deduction of the net income by 30 percent of the total investment value. This is charged at five percent per year for six years, in the form of intangible assets, including land.
### Accelerated depreciation of tangible fixed assets
The government allows accelerated depreciation of tangible assets for incentivized regions, calculated as follows.
Type of fixed tangible asset |  Benefit period |  Depreciation rates and method  
---|---|---  
Straight line method |  Declining balance method  
Non-buildings  
Category I |  2 years |  50% |  100%  
Category II |  4 years |  25% |  50%  
Category III |  8 years |  12.5% |  25%  
Category IV |  10 years |  10% |  20%  
Buildings  
Permanent |  10 years |  10% |  –  
Non-permanent |  5 years |  20% |  –  
### Accelerated amortization of intangible assets
The government allows the accelerated amortization of intangible assets for incentivized regions, as calculated below.
Type of intangible assets |  Benefit period |  Amortization rate  
---|---|---  
Straight line method |  Declining balance method  
Category I |  2 years |  50% |  100%  
Category II |  4 years |  25% |  50%  
Category III |  8 years |  12.5% |  25%  
Category IV |  10 years |  10% |  20%  
### Compensation for losses
Compensation is available for losses of more than five years but for no more than 10 years.
An additional one-year of compensation is granted if investors implement one of several options laid out in the regulation. These are:
  * Invest in a sector and region as stated under GR 78/ 2019;
  * Invest in industrial or bonded zones;
  * Engage in activities related to renewable energy;
  * Assign 10 billion Rupiah (US$650,745) on social infrastructure programs;
  * Utilize at least 70 percent of domestic raw materials or components by the second year of operations; or
  * Employ at least 300 local workers and maintain this number for four consecutive years.


To gain a further two-year extension, investors can:
  * Employ 600 Indonesians and maintain this number for four consecutive years;
  * Assign at least five percent of their total investment value to research and development aimed at improving their products or services; or
  * Export at least 30 percent of their total sales in a fiscal year (applies to specific sectors and are not located in bonded zones).


### Reduction in income tax on dividends
Investors can also receive a reduction on their income tax on dividends at a rate of 10 percent. This can be lowered even further if there is an applicable double tax avoidance agreement in place.
## Tax incentives for investments in labor-intensive industries, training programs, and R&D
### Labor intensive industries
Taxpayers can enjoy a net income reduction of 60 percent of their total investment in the form of tangible fixed assets if they invest or expand into labor-intensive or pioneer industries.
The Taxpayers that invest or expand into labor-intensive or pioneer industries can enjoy a net income reduction of 60 percent of their total investment in the form of tangible fixed assets, which includes any land used for the main business activities over a certain period.
The Ministry of Industry defines a labor-intensive industry as one that employs a minimum of 200 workers with labor costs not exceeding 15 percent of production costs. The Ministry of Finance defines a pioneer industry as one that provides value-added economic consequences to the surrounding areas, introduces new technologies, and provides strategic value for the national economy.
### R&D activities
Taxpayers that engage in R&D initiatives can receive a tax incentive of 300 percent in gross income reduction of total costs incurred. To avail this incentive, the taxpayer must be conducting R&D that is assessed by the government to be advancing the national economy, new industries, and technologies, or transfer of foreign technology to local businesses.
The maximum 300 percent tax facility covers the following:
  * 100 percent reduction on gross revenue for costs of conducting the R&D activities; and
  * A maximum 200 percent additional reduction to the gross revenue incurred to conduct the R&D activities within a certain period. This is as follows:
    * 50 percent reduction if the R&D generates intellectual property (IP) rights such as in the form of a patent;
    * 25 percent reduction if the R&D generates IP rights that are registered domestically as well as abroad;
    * 100 percent reduction if the R&D reaches commercialization; and
    * 25 percent reduction if the R&D generates IP rights in the form of a patent as defined in the first two points, and/or reaches the commercialization stage if the R&D activity is carried out in collaboration with Indonesian R&D institutions or higher learning institutions.


### Training programs
Investors can receive a gross income reduction of up to 200 percent of the total costs incurred, who are looking to start apprenticeship programs or training activities to develop workers based on ‘certain competencies.’ The regulation defines certain competencies as developing human resources that can meet the labor requirements needed by national industries and businesses.
## Incentives in Indonesia’s special economic zones
Indonesia aims to make its special economic zones (SEZs) a policy priority to attract foreign investment, boost industrial activity, and promote job creation. This strategy has been further facilitated through various **incentive programs available throughout the special economic zones in Indonesia**⟨96⟩.
### Exemption on corporate income tax
Business stakeholders in an SEZ are differentiated into two types of taxpayers: 
  * _Badan usaha_(business entities) and 
  * _Pelaku usaha_(businesspersons).


Both business entities and business players are eligible for a 100 percent reduction in corporate income tax (CIT) provided that their investments are conducted in SEZs and with a minimum investment value of 100 billion rupiah (US$7 million), for 10 years.
Corporate Income Tax Holidays for Special Economic Zones in Indonesia  
---  
Taxpayer |  Investment amount |  Concession period (years)  
Business entity |  100 billion rupiah (US$7 million) |  10  
Businessperson |  Between 100 billion rupiah (US$7 million) to 500 billion rupiah (US$35 million) |  10

More than 1 trillion rupiah (US$70 million) |  20  
After the CIT mentioned above incentives expire, taxpayers are eligible for a 50 percent CIT reduction payable for the subsequent two years. Further, during the concession period, no withholding tax (WHT) is applied to eligible income, such as income from land and building rental.
### Corporate income tax allowance
Taxpayers that invest 100 billion rupiah (US$7 million) are also eligible to receive several CIT allowances. These are:
  * A 30 percent reduction in net income on the total investment on fixed assets reduced over six years over six years, at five percent per year;
  * Accelerated depreciation allowances of up to 100 percent of tangible and intangible assets;
  * A WHT rate of 10 percent, or the treaty rate (whichever is lower) on dividend payments made to non-resident recipients; and
  * Tax loss is carried forward for up to 10 years.


### Import and excise duties
Import duties, tax on the importation, and excise duties are all exempted on the following dutiable/taxable goods:
  * Capital goods used for the construction or development of SEZs for five years;
  * For the entry of consumable raw materials for service industries (for tourism SEZs); and
  * Entry of goods to be sold in shops and shopping centers (for tourism SEZs).


### VAT and sales tax on luxury goods
VAT will not be collected in relation to the following activities:
  * The import of taxable tangible goods into an SEZ by a business entity;
  * The delivery of taxable tangible goods from another Indonesian free trade zone, customs area, or bonded storage facilities to a business entity;
  * The delivery of taxable services or goods, including land or buildings by a business entity in an SEZ to another business entity in the same or another SEZ; and
  * The import of consumer goods into a tourism SEZ.


The non-collection of VAT also applies to raw materials needed to produce taxable services or goods related to ship and aircraft maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) activities.
### Right of foreigners to own apartments and landed houses in special economic zones
**Indonesia has made it easier for foreigners to own real estate**⟨97⟩ in special economic zones, free trade zones, industrial zones, or other economic zones (tourism zones, suburban zones, or urban zones).
The properties owned by foreigners are subject to certain restrictions such as:
  * Minimum price;
  * Land area and number of apartment units;
  * Residential zoning; and
  * Land space.


The minimum price for landed houses and apartment units varies between provinces.

### Immigration
There is special treatment for foreign workers in special economic zones. Foreign workers can obtain temporary resident status for themselves and their families, and they could obtain permanent resident status if they hold property in the SEZ.
### Business licenses
The Indonesian government has eased the issuance of business licenses through the Online Single Submission website for investors operating in SEZs.
## Right to use, right to build, and right to cultivate for foreign investors
There are several land titles that foreign investors should be aware of. These are:
  * Right to manage (_Hak Pengelolaan, HPL_);
  * Right to cultivate (_Hak Guna Usaha_ ,  _HGU_);
  * Right to use (_Hak Pakai, HP_);
  * Right to build (_Hak Guna Bangunan_ ,  _HGB_)
  * Right of ownership over stacked units (_Hak Milik Atas Satuan Rumah Susun_ ,  _HMSRS_);
  * Rights for underground and overground space; and
  * Land registration


There are two types of right-to-use (HP) titles:
  * Right to use within a certain period; and
  * Right to use for land used for specific purposes.


This land title usually refers to the right to use/harvest land directly owned by the state or private land. This land could also be used for a building site in addition to agricultural purposes.
The right to use the title for a certain period can be granted to foreign legal entities that have a representative office, foreign citizens, as well as local entities and citizens. This encompasses state land, freehold title land, and the right to manage land.
If granted for state land and the right to manage land, the title is for a maximum term of 30 years and extendable for another 20. Once the period expires, the title can be extended for another 30 years (a total of 80 years).
HGU, HGB, and HP title holders must commence activities on the land, whether building construction, cultivation, or other use of land, within two years of the title being granted.
## Incentives for Indonesia’s New Capital City Project
Indonesia’s government offers various **fiscal and non-fiscal incentives to businesses seeking to invest in Indonesia’s new capital city, Nusantara⟨99⟩.**
Nusantara is estimated to cost US$35 billion to construct and the central government is expected to begin operations in the new city in 2024.
### Income tax reductions and holidays
The government will provide up to 100 percent corporate income tax exemption of between 10 and 30 years for domestic taxpayers that invest at least 10 billion rupiah (US$650,745) in the new capital. The duration of the incentive depends on the sectors in which the investment is directed.
For instance, investing in public services will receive the longest tax holiday up until 2035. Banks and insurers that invest before 2035 can enjoy up to 25 years of income tax exemption whereas those that invest before 2045 can receive up to 20 years of income tax exemption.
#### Other sectors Include:
Developers of other critical infrastructure, such as public works, airports, seaports, and housing, can also benefit from the incentives, as well as businesses that engage in economic development through the construction of hotels, malls, energy infrastructure, and software, among many others.
Corporate income tax reductions will be available for investors that develop financial centers in the new capital, as well as for companies that relocate their head offices to the new capital. Moreover, investors that implement certain research and development activities will be afforded a reduction in their gross income.
Further, micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in certain business activities will also pay a zero percent corporate income tax rate.

### Utilization of foreign workers
Businesses operating in the new capital city will be allowed to employ foreign workers for 10 years; this can also be extended. The foreign worker can also secure residency permits for 10 years, which is also extendable depending on their employment contract.
The employer is also exempted from paying the Foreign Worker Compensation Fund, which is the amount of US$100 paid every month to the Ministry of Manpower.
The residency permits of foreign workers who hold management positions in companies operating in the new capital will remain valid as long as they retain that said position.
### Land rights
The government offers investors 95-year land use permits, which can be extended for another 95 years and thus totaling 190 years for land use.
There will be two categories of land in Indonesia’s new capital:
  * State-owned property that will be managed by the Nusantara Capital City Authority (a special agency tasked with governing and managing the new capital city) and
  * Assets that have been granted to the capital city authority through the right-to-manage (_Hak Pengelolaan – HPL_) deed titles.


The capital city authority can allocate these HPL lands to businesses for the following land rights/titles:
  * Right to cultivate (_Hak Guna Usaha_ – HGU);
  * Right to build (_Hak Guna Bangunan –_ HGB); and
  * Right to use (_Hak Pakai – HP_).

Types of land rights/titles |  Allowed activities |  Validity for new capital city, Nusantara |  Validity for other cities  
---|---|---|---  
Right to cultivate title (HGU) |  HGU gives the user the right to work/cultivate the land for a specific period. This land title is usually granted for agricultural activities, such as plantations. |  Holders of the HGU title will be allowed to cultivate the land for 95 years, which can then be extended for another 95 years, totaling 190 years. |  HGU title is valid for 35 years and extendable for another 35 years upon expiration.  
Right to build title (HGB)  |  HGB is granted to Indonesian citizens and foreign companies to erect a building on the land. |  HGB title holders will be eligible to hold the title for 80 years, which can be extended for another 80 years, totaling 160 years. |  HGB title holders can only hold the title for 30 years, and extendable for 20 years. Once this period has expired, the title can be renewed for another 30 years, so 80 years in total.  
Right-to-use (HP): This title refers to the right to use or harvest the land owned by the state or private persons. |  This land could also be used for a building site in addition to agricultural purposes. This title can be granted to foreign legal entities that have a representative office, foreign citizens, as well as local entities and citizens, for a certain period. This includes state land, freehold title land, and the right to manage land. |  The HP title |  The HP title is granted for 25 years and extended for another 20 years, before a final renewal of 25 years, totaling 70 years.  
### Customs
The government offers exemptions on import duties for the import of goods used for the construction and development of Indonesia’s new capital. There are import duty exemptions for the import of goods and materials used in the construction and development of industries within the new capital.

# Personal Income Tax in Indonesia
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/taxation-and-accounting/individual-income-tax)
An individual’s income is subject to 5% to 35% of progressive income tax rates.
  

Contributing Advisor
Expatriate workers need to know that personal income tax (PIT) in Indonesia is determined through a self-assessment scheme.
The country has adopted a worldwide income taxation system, meaning that individuals considered as Indonesian tax residents must pay tax to the government on the income they earned in Indonesia, and also on income they earned from abroad, unless there is an applicable double tax agreement.
Non-resident taxpayers will only be liable to pay PIT for income they earn in Indonesia, unless the country in which they are a tax resident has an applicable tax treaty with Indonesia. In these cases, the taxpayer might not pay any tax in Indonesia or pay a reduced amount.
Given these tax treatments, it is important for expatriate workers to understand their tax liabilities in Indonesia. It is advisable to use the services of registered local tax advisors to help determine which tax law regime will be applicable along with any exemptions that may bring.
## Who is eligible to pay Personal Income Tax?
An individual is considered a domestic tax subject if they were present in the country for more than 183 days during a 12-month period, or they have an intention to stay in Indonesia.
The government has provided further clarification on the definition of ‘residing in Indonesia’ and the ‘intention to stay in Indonesia’.
‘Residing in Indonesia’ is defined as an individual who:
  * Lives at a place of residence in Indonesia that is at their disposal and can be accessed at all times, which they own, rent, and is not a place of transit;
  * Have their vital interests in Indonesia; and
  * Have their habitual abode in Indonesia.


An ‘intention to stay in Indonesia’ needs to be substantiated with the following documents:
  * A permanent stay permit;
  * A limited stay visa;
  * A limited stay permit; or
  * Other documents that support their stay of more than 183 days in Indonesia.


### Territorial taxation for foreigners
Foreigners who have become domestic tax subjects will only be taxed on Indonesian-sourced income. This is only applicable if they meet the expertise requirements from Appendix II of PMK-18.
Their expertise, however, must be supported by:
  * A certificate issued by a government-authorized institution, or have a minimum of five years’ work experience in the field of science, technology, and math; and
  * An obligation for knowledge transfer to an Indonesian citizen.


Did You Know
The territorial tax treatment is available for four years of residency. If the foreign individual leaves Indonesia and re-enters Indonesia within the four-year period, the territorial taxation will begin from the time they first became a domestic tax subject.
Foreigners looking to apply for the territorial tax treatment must do so through the Directorate General of Taxes (DGS). Those who were already a domestic tax subject prior to the issuance of PMK-18/2021 can also apply to the DGS for this tax treatment.
### Individuals exempted from Personal Income Tax
Certain foreign expatriates, because of their special legal status, are not considered as Indonesian tax residents and are exempted from paying PIT, even if they stay for more than 183 days per year or reside and intend to stay in Indonesia.
These exemptions apply for:
  * Foreign diplomatic and consular personnel;
  * Military personnel and civilian employees of foreign armed services; and
  * Representatives of international organizations specified by the Minister of


## Tax rate
Residents and non-residents are taxed differently:
  * Residents are subject to a withholding progressive tax (their net taxable income is set at graduated rates, with current rates ranging from five percent up to a maximum of 35 percent, depending on an individual’s income); and
  * Non-residents are subject to a final withholding flat tax of 20 percent on gross income.

Personal Income Tax Rates in Indonesia  
---  
Annual income |  Rate (%)  
Up to 60 million rupiah (US$3,869) |  5%  
Above 60 million rupiah (US$3,883) to 250 million rupiah (US$16,120) |  15%  
Above 250 million (US$16,120) to 500 million rupiah (US$32,239) |  25%  
Above 500 million rupiah (US$32,239) to 5 billion rupiah (US$323, 000) |  30%  
Above 5 billion rupiah (US$322,395) |  35%  
## Deductions and relief
Several elements can be deduced from the gross income when determining the annual taxable income of an individual. A family is regarded as a single tax reporting unit with a single tax identity number (NPWP) in the name of the head of the family. The head of the family needs to report the income of their dependent spouse and children on their tax return. The following personal deductions are available for resident taxpayers.
### Employer compliance obligations
Income tax in Indonesia is mostly paid by withholding by the employer. The tax withheld by employers must be remitted to the government body every month.
Income Tax Deductions in Indonesia  
---  
Basic of deduction |  Deductible amount per year  
Individual taxpayer |  54 million rupiah (US$3,482)  
Spouse |  Additional 4.5 million rupiah (US$290)  
Each dependent (max. 3) |  Additional 4.5 million rupiah (US$290)  
### Employee compliance obligations
Expatriate employees are required to complete an annual tax return and compute their tax liability by March 31 of the following tax year. The majority of PIT is paid through statutory employer withholdings on earned income. However, for any other income that a taxpayer in Indonesia earns regularly, they must make monthly provisional tax payments to the tax department based on the income earned in the previous year.
## Filing a tax return
To file a tax return, an individual must register as a taxpayer in order to obtain a tax identification number (NPWP). Expatriates must obtain an NPWP if they are a tax resident. While employers are responsible for deducting tax from their employees’ salaries, it is the individual employee’s responsibility to register as a taxpayer and file their tax returns.
### Who is required to report their individual tax returns?
Individuals who are required to report their taxes are referred to as “taxpayers”. A person can be a taxpayer when they meet the subjective and objective requirements.
The subjective requirements are of two categories:
#### Domestic tax subject
  * An individual residing in Indonesia, or
  * An individual who is in Indonesia for more than 183 days within a 12-month period; or
  * An individual who is in Indonesia during the tax year and plans to stay in Indonesia.


#### Foreign tax subject
  * An individual who does not reside in Indonesia or has not resided in Indonesia for more than 183 days within 12 months but runs a business or carries out activities through a permanent establishment in Indonesia; or
  * An individual who does not reside in Indonesia or has not resided in Indonesia for more than 183 days within 12 months but earns an income from Indonesia from means other than not from running a business.


The objective requirements are essentially any additional economic capacity received or obtained by a taxpayer, both from Indonesia and from elsewhere that can be used for consumption or to increase the taxpayer’s wealth, in whatever name and form.
### How do you report your individual tax returns in Indonesia?
There are several ways to report your individual tax return in Indonesia:
  * Directly to the tax office;
  * Through postal or expedition services; and
  * Authorized online tax services.


### Tax deregistration when leaving Indonesia
It is recommended that expatriates leaving Indonesia should permanently cancel their tax registration to avoid any misunderstandings, and thus avoid being continuously considered a tax resident of Indonesia.
To do so, expatriates should apply to the local tax office, which will then perform a tax audit on the taxpayer’s returns and supporting documents prior to approving to deregister.
The individual should ensure that all tax-related documents are readily available in anticipation of a tax audit (including bank statements, salary slips, foreign tax documentation if applicable, work contracts, etc.).
### Dividends and offshore income exempted from income tax
To increase investments in Indonesia’s financial markets and the real sector, the government has provided income tax exemptions for foreign dividends received by domestic taxpayers. The reinvestment requirements are not required for domestic dividends received by domestic corporate taxpayers.
Such concessions will require reinvestment for a certain period from when the dividend is received. PMK-18/2021 provides details on these reinvestment requirements:
Qualifying reinvestments are as follows:
  * Investment in financial market instruments such as:
  * Government bonds, including shariah instruments;
  * Bonds or  _Sukuk_ issued by a state-owned enterprise, private companies;
  * Financial investments in perception banks including shariah banks; or
  * Other legal forms of investments.


Investments in financial instruments outside the money market include:
  * Investment in the real sector;
  * Investment in infrastructure through a private-public partnership;
  * Equity cooperation in an already existing company domiciled in Indonesia;
  * Cooperation with the Indonesian Sovereign Wealth Fund; or
  * Lending to small and medium-sized businesses in Indonesia.


The investment must be held for a minimum of three years from when the dividend or offshore income is received. The taxpayer must also invest he dividend or offshore income in the qualifying investments by the end of the third or fourth month after the end of the fiscal year. Finally, the investment cannot be transferred except to another qualifying investment.
Type of income |  Reinvestment required |  Thresold (%)  
---|---|---  
Domestic dividends received by corporate taxpayers |  No |  N/A  
Domestic dividends received by domestic individual taxpayers |  Yes |  No  
Offshore dividends received by corporate taxpayers - from a listed company |  Yes |  No  
Offshore dividends received by domestic taxpayers - from a listed company |  Yes |  30  
Offshore income received from a permanent establishment (PE) |  Yes |  30  
Offshore income received from an active business (not from a PE or subsidiary) |  Yes |  No  
_Note: 30 percent from profit after tax_ _Source: PwC - Taxflash_  
If the reinvestment requirement provides a 30 percent threshold, the taxpayer can enjoy the full exemption if this threshold is fulfilled. However, if the reinvestment is less than the 30 percent threshold, the taxpayer must pay income tax on the spread between the investment amount and the 30 percent threshold to enjoy the exemption.
Investors should note that the exemption does not apply to foreign citizens who utilize the DTA between Indonesia and the partner country/jurisdiction of the DTA.
### Scope of taxable income in Indonesia
  * According to the Personal Income Tax Law, income must be defined as any increase in economic capacity. It can consist of, among others, employment income, and personal investment income. 
    * Income includes: 
      * Employment income;
      * Income from the exercise of an independent profession or business;
      * Passive income (dividends, royalties, interest, insurance gains);
      * Capital gains (from the sale or transfer of property); and
      * Rents and other income from the use of property.

# Incentives for Doing Business in Indonesia
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/why-indonesia/incentives-for-doing-business-in-indonesia)
Indonesia has enhanced and improved the incentives offered to businesses in a bid to spur foreign and domestic investments into the country.
  

Contributing Advisor
The government has reduced more than 70 labor, tax, and other key laws to reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies, simplify business licensing requirements, and liberalize more industries for foreign investors.
## Tax incentives in priority sectors
Companies that invest a certain amount in one of the 246 priority business lines will receive fiscal and non-fiscal incentives.
Fiscal incentives include a 50 percent corporate income tax reduction for investments between 100 billion rupiah (US$6.6 million) and 500 billion rupiah (US$33.3 million) for a period of five years and a 100 percent CIT reduction for investments over 500 billion rupiah (US$33.3 million) for a period between five and 20 years.
There are tax allowances available in the form of a 30 percent reduction in the taxable income on the total investment for six years, a special withholding tax rate on dividends of 10 percent, and tax losses carried forward for up to 10 years.

## Tax allowance in specific sectors and regions
There are a variety of income tax incentives for businesses investing in specific provinces (such as Aceh, Greater Jakarta, and Riau) and industries, such as marine and fisheries⟨93⟩, pharmaceuticals, IT, and energy, among others, in the country.
These incentives come in the form of tax deductions, the accelerated depreciation of fixed tangible assets, and the accelerated amortization of intangible assets. There is also an increase in the period for fiscal loss compensation, in addition to setting the income tax rate on dividends for foreign taxpayers at 10 percent.

## Tax incentives in labor-intensive industries, training, and R&D
### Labor intensive industries
Taxpayers that invest or expand into labor-intensive or pioneer industries can enjoy a net income reduction of 60 percent of their total investment in the form of tangible fixed assets, which includes any land used for the main business activities over a certain period.
The Ministry of Industry defines a labor-intensive industry as one that employs a minimum of 200 workers with labor costs not exceeding 15 percent of production costs, while the Ministry of Finance defines a pioneer industry as one that provides value-added economic consequences to the surrounding areas, introduces new technologies, and provides strategic value for the national economy.
### R&D activities
Taxpayers that engage in R&D initiatives can receive a tax benefit of 300 percent in gross income reduction of total costs incurred. To avail of this facility, the taxpayer must be conducting R&D that is assessed by the government to be advancing the national economy, new industries, and technologies, or transfer of foreign technology to local businesses.
### Training programs
Investors looking to start apprenticeship programs or training activities to develop workers based on ‘certain competencies’ can receive a gross income reduction of up to 200 percent of the total costs incurred. The regulation defines certain competencies as developing human resources that can meet the labor requirements needed by national industries and businesses.
## Incentives in Indonesia’s special economic zones
Indonesia aims to make its special economic zones (SEZs)⟨94⟩ a policy priority to attract foreign investment, boost industrial activity, and promote job creation. This strategy has been further facilitated through various incentive programs available throughout the special economic zones in Indonesia⟨94⟩.
### Exemption on corporate income tax
Business stakeholders in an SEZ are differentiated into two types of taxpayers: 
  * Badan usaha (business entities) and 
  * Pelaku usaha (businesspersons).


Both business entities and business players are eligible for a 100 percent reduction in corporate income tax (CIT) provided that their investments are conducted in SEZs and with a minimum investment value of 100 billion rupiah (US$7 million), for 10 years.
Corporate Income Tax Holidays for Special Economic Zones in Indonesia  
---  
Taxpayer |  Investment amount |  Concession period (years)  
Business entity |  100 billion rupiah (US$7 million) |  10  
Businessperson |  Between 100 billion rupiah (US$7 million) to 500 billion rupiah (US$35 million) |  10  
Between 500 billion rupiah (US$35 million) to 1 trillion rupiah (US$70 million) |  15  
More than 1 trillion rupiah (US$70 million) |  20  
After the CIT mentioned above incentives expire, taxpayers are eligible for a 50 percent CIT reduction payable for the subsequent two years. Further, during the concession period, no withholding tax (WHT) is applied to eligible income, such as income from land and building rental.
## Corporate income tax allowance
Taxpayers that invest 100 billion rupiah (US$7 million) are also eligible to receive several Corporate Income Tax ⟨52⟩allowances. These are:
  * A 30 percent reduction in net income on the total investment on fixed assets reduced over six years over six years, at five percent per year;
  * Accelerated depreciation allowances of up to 100 percent of tangible and intangible assets;
  * A WHT rate of 10 percent, or the treaty rate (whichever is lower) on dividend payments made to non-resident recipients; and
  * Tax loss is carried forward for up to 10 years.


### Import and excise duties
Import duties, tax on the importation, and excise duties are all exempted on the following dutiable/taxable goods:
  * Capital goods used for the construction or development of SEZs for five years;
  * For the entry of consumable raw materials for service industries (for tourism SEZs); and
  * Entry of goods to be sold in shops and shopping centers (for tourism SEZs).


### VAT and sales tax on luxury goods
  * VAT will not be collected in relation to the following activities:
  * The import of taxable tangible goods into an SEZ by a business entity;
  * The delivery of taxable tangible goods from another Indonesian free trade zone, customs area, or bonded storage facilities to a business entity;
  * The delivery of taxable services or goods, including land or buildings by a business entity in an SEZ to another business entity in the same or another SEZ; and
  * The import of consumer goods into a tourism SEZ.


The non-collection of Value Added Tax⟨54⟩ also applies to raw materials needed to produce taxable services or goods related to ship and aircraft maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) activities.
Right of foreigners to own apartments and landed houses in special economic zones.
Indonesia has made it easier for foreigners to own real estate⟨95⟩ in special economic zones, free trade zones, industrial zones, or other economic zones (tourism zones, suburban zones, or urban zones).
### Immigration
Foreign workers in special economic zones can obtain temporary resident status for themselves and their families. They could obtain permanent resident status if they hold property in the SEZ.
### Business licenses
The Indonesian government has eased the issuance of business licenses through the Online Single Submission website for investors operating in SEZs.
## Right to use, build, and cultivate for foreign investors
There are several land titles that foreign investors should be aware of. These are:
  * Right to manage (Hak Pengelolaan, HPL);
  * Right to cultivate (Hak Guna Usaha, HGU);
  * Right to use (Hak Pakai, HP);
  * Right to build (Hak Guna Bangunan, HGB)
  * Right of ownership over stacked units (Hak Milik Atas Satuan Rumah Susun, HMSRS);
  * Rights for underground and overground space; and
  * Land registration.


There are two types of right-to-use (HP) titles:
  * Right to use within a certain period; and
  * Right to use for land used for specific purposes.


This land title usually refers to the right to use/harvest land directly owned by the state or private land. This land could also be used for a building site in addition to agricultural purposes.
The right to use the title for a certain period can be granted to foreign legal entities that have a representative office, foreign citizens, as well as local entities and citizens. This encompasses state land, freehold title land, and the right to manage land.
If granted for state land and the right to manage land, the title is for a maximum term of 30 years and extendable for another 20. Once the period expires, the title can be extended for another 30 years (a total of 80 years).
Did You Know
HGU, HGB, and HP title holders must commence activities on the land, whether building construction, cultivation, or other use of land, within two years of the title being granted.
For more information on HGU and HGB title holders, click here.
## Incentives for Indonesia’s New Capital City Project: Nusantara
Jakarta is planning to relocate its capital to its new capital city of Nusantara⟨96⟩, which is now under construction, and is expected to support government operations in 2024. The Indonesian government is offering a range of incentives to businesses that are planning to establish and operate in its new capital city.
### Income tax reductions and holidays
The government will provide up to 100 percent corporate income tax exemption of between 10 and 30 years for domestic taxpayers that invest at least 10 billion rupiah (US$650,745) in the new capital. The duration of the incentive depends on the sectors in which the investment is directed. For instance:
  * Investing in public services will receive the longest tax holiday up until 2035;
  * Banks and insurers that invest before 2035 can enjoy up to 25 years of income tax exemption whereas those that invest before 2045 can receive up to 20 years of income tax exemption;
  * Developers of other critical infrastructure, such as public works, airports, seaports, and housing, can also benefit from the incentives, as well as businesses that engage in economic development through the construction of hotels, malls, energy infrastructure, and software, among many others;
  * Corporate income tax reductions will be available for investors that develop financial centers in the new capital, as well as for companies that relocate their head offices to the new capital;
  * Investors that implement certain research and development activities will be afforded a reduction in their gross income; and
  * Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in certain business activities will also pay a zero percent corporate income tax rate.


### Utilization of foreign workers
Businesses operating in the new capital city will be allowed to employ foreign workers for 10 years; this can also be extended. The foreign worker can also secure residency permits for 10 years, which is also extendable depending on their employment contract.

The employer is also exempted from paying the Foreign Worker Compensation Fund, which is the amount of US$100 paid every month to the Ministry of Manpower.
The residency permits of foreign workers who hold management positions in companies operating in the new capital will remain valid as long as they retain that said position.
### Land rights
The government is offering investors 95-year land use permits, which can be extended for another 95 years and thus totaling 190 years for land use.
There will be two categories of land in Indonesia’s new capital:
  * State-owned property that will be managed by the Nusantara Capital City Authority (a special agency tasked with governing and managing the new capital city) and
  * Assets that have been granted to the capital city authority through the right-to-manage (Hak Pengelolaan – HPL) deed titles.


The capital city authority can allocate these HPL lands to businesses for the following land rights/titles:
  * Right to cultivate (Hak Guna Usaha – HGU);
  * Right to build (Hak Guna Bangunan – HGB); and
  * Right to use (Hak Pakai – HP).


### Customs
The government offers exemptions on import duties for the import of goods used for the construction and development of Indonesia’s new capital. Further, there are import duty exemptions for the import of goods and materials used in the construction and development of industries within the new capital.

# Indonesia's Double Tax Avoidance Agreements
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/why-indonesia/indonesia-s-double-tax-avoidance-agreements)
Global investors often find themselves in an unfavorable position of having to face being double taxed – taxed by two different countries on the same income – unless there is a Double Tax Avoidance Agreement in place. For example, a company might be subject to taxes in its native or resident country, and also in another foreign country where it has raised income by providing labor, or via a foreign-invested company that provides goods or services.
  

Contributing Advisor
Did You Know
Double Tax Avoidance Agreements (DTA) treaties effectively eliminate double taxation in specific cases by identifying exemptions or reducing the amount of taxes payable.
It is therefore important for foreign investors, or expatriates working in Indonesia, to be aware of any DTAs that may exist between Indonesia and the native countries that apply to them, and to understand how these agreements are applied in practice between their native or resident countries and Indonesia.
## Countries that have signed DTAAs with Indonesia
Indonesia has signed 71 DTAAs. These agreements ensure the elimination of double taxation on income earned from the taxpayer’s country of residence and Indonesia in the form of reduced withholding tax rates on dividends, interests, and royalties and withholding tax exemptions on services fees.

## Who do DTAAs apply to?
The provisions of DTAAs apply to individuals and companies who are residents of one or both contracting states. The term “persons” refers to any entity recognized as a taxpayer for tax purposes.
An individual is considered a tax resident in Indonesia⟨93⟩ if they have been present in the country for more than 183 days within a 12-month period, or if they intend to stay in Indonesia. In such cases, they will be considered domestic tax subjects. The government has clarified further the definition of ‘residing in Indonesia’ and the ‘intention to stay in Indonesia’.
For the purposes of taxation, an individual is considered to be “residing in Indonesia” if they meet the following criteria:
  * They live in a place of residence in Indonesia that is under their control and can be accessed at any time, which they either own or rent and is not a place of transit;
  * They have significant personal or vital interests in Indonesia; and
  * They have their regular or habitual residence in Indonesia.


An ‘intention to stay in Indonesia’ needs to be substantiated with the following documents:
  * A permanent stay permit;
  * A limited stay visa;
  * A limited stay permit; or
  * Other documents support their stay of more than 183 days in Indonesia.


## Claiming benefits under the DTAAs
To claim benefits under a DTAA, the applicant must present a Certificate of Domicile (CoD) to the local tax office. This document presented either in the form prescribed by Indonesia’s Directorate General of Taxes or in the form of the double tax treaty partner country, is required for a party to be entitled to the tax benefit. Without this document, the party will be subject to the normal 20 percent tax rate.
### The anti-treaty abuse tests
In addition to the CoD, the applicant must fulfill the anti-treaty abuse tests, which apply to all income types derived from Indonesia. These include examining whether:
  * The entity has sufficient employees with expertise in accordance with its line of business;
  * The entity has business activities or activities other than receiving income from royalties, interest, and dividends sourced from Indonesia;
  * The entity has fixed and non-fixed assets to adequately conduct business other than the assets generating income from Indonesia;
  * The entity has relevant economic substance either in the entity’s establishment or the execution of its transaction; and
  * The entity has its own management team and has independent discretion to conduct transactions for the entity.


### Beneficial ownership test
The DTAA applicant must also fulfill the beneficial ownership test. The intent of this rule is to assist tax authorities in counteracting financial crimes, such as money laundering and tax evasion. Under the test, authorities will examine whether:
  * The entity is not acting as an agent or nominee;
  * The entity uses no more than 50 percent of its income to fulfill obligations to other parties;
  * The entity has the controlling rights on the assets that generate the income; and
  * The entity has no obligation to transfer the income received to residents of a third country.


### Taxable income covered by DTAAs
#### Dividends
Dividends under an Indonesian DTAA are subject to a final tax rate of between seven to 20 percent depending on the DTAA partner. Resident taxpayers are required to withhold a tax rate of 20 percent for dividend payments to taxpayers whose country of residence does not have a DTAA with Indonesia.
#### Interest and royalties
Income from interest or royalties is subject to a tax rate of 20 percent for non-resident corporations and individuals. Under a DTAA, the tax rate for income from interest can be reduced to between zero and 15 percent, depending on the DTAA country partner, and between 10-15 percent for royalties.

### Indonesia-Korea Comprehensive Economic Partnership
The Indonesia-Korea Comprehensive Economic Partnership (IK-CEPA) eliminates 95 percent of Indonesia’s tariffs on exports to South Korea and 92 percent of South Korean tariffs on exports to Indonesia.

The RCEP sets to eliminate 92 percent of tariffs on goods traded among its 15 members. For Indonesia, the RCEP could boost the country’s trade surplus by US$979 million, more than double the current trade surplus of US$383 million by 2040.
## FTAs as a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
### ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement
The ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) was established to consolidate and streamline all the provisions under the Common Effective Preferential Tariff for ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (CEPT-AFTA).
To ensure the free flow of goods in ASEAN, the ATIGA comprises elements such as tariff liberalization, trade facilitation, and removing non-tariff barriers.
### ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area
The ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area (AANZFTA) eliminates 90 percent of goods traded between ASEAN, Australia, and New Zealand. The FTA covers approximately a population of 653 million and over US$4.3 trillion. 
### ASEAN-China Free Trade Area
Through the ASEAN-China Free Trade Area (ACFTA), China has consistently ranked as ASEAN’s largest investor over the last decade, with total trade of over US$731 billion in 2020.
Did You Know
The FTA reduced tariffs on more than 7,000 product categories — or 90 percent of imports — to zero by 2010.
### ASEAN-India Free Trade Area
The signing of the ASEAN-India Trade Area (AIFTA) agreement paved the way for the creation of one of the world’s largest free trade area markets, creating opportunities for over 1.9 billion people in ASEAN and India with a combined GDP of US$4.8 trillion. The agreement set off tariff liberalization on over 90 percent of products.
### ASEAN-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership
The ASEAN–Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership (AJCEP) covers trade in services, goods, investments, and economic cooperation.
The FTA eliminates taxes on 87 percent of all tariff lines and adds a dispute resolution system. It also allows for back-to-back shipment of goods between member countries, third-party invoicing of goods, and ASEAN cumulation.
## Indonesia’s Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements network
Indonesia has signed 71 DTAAs. These agreements ensure the elimination of double taxation on income earned from the taxpayer’s country of residence and Indonesia in the form of reduced withholding tax rates on dividends, interests, and royalties and withholding tax exemptions on services fees. Foreign investors should seek the help of registered tax advisors to better understand how they can benefit from this network.

# Why Foreign Companies Relocate to Indonesia?
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/why-indonesia/why-foreign-companies-relocate-to-indonesia)
Indonesia’s economy has developed dynamically since the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, achieving growth rates of approx. six percent. The country achieved negative GDP of -2 percent in 2020 for the first time in 20 years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the decline was rather moderate compared to its regional peers in ASEAN.
  

Contributing Advisor
Beyond its scale of economic growth, Indonesia offers numerous other, significant advantages to firms that are considering alternative markets in the South Asia region.
## Indonesia as a China +1 option
Many businesses are turning to Indonesia as a second Asia investment option for certain types of consumer related market opportunities such as retail, health, and financial services. Recent global supply chain and trade shocks, as well as higher costs of labor have propelled Indonesia as a viable option for a China+1 strategy. The country boasts an enormous labor pool, growing middle class, and a vast wealth of natural resources.

For investors making long-term commitments and eyeing new growth opportunities, Indonesia may be the most attractive option to complement operations in China. Compared to its ASEAN peers, Indonesia stands out from the rest due to its size and resource wealth. Indonesia projects to become one of the world’s largest economies on the back of a young workforce and rapidly expanding middle class.
Indonesia as a “China plus one” destination offers a strong alternative for dealing with rising costs in China and unpredictable scenarios such as trade shocks. Foreign investors may look at Indonesia to supplement their China operations for its lower-cost inputs, alternate markets, and as a gateway to the ASEAN and South Asia markets.
## Strong Free Trade and Double Tax agreements
### Free Trade Agreements
As an autonomous market and a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Indonesia has signed and executed a number of free trade agreements with countries and regions all over the world. This includes the (ASEAN)Free Trade Area and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership; two of the largest FTA in the world.
The (ASEAN) Free Trade Area (AFTA) was signed in 1992 with the aim to be a catalyst to help ASEAN become a production base for global markets. Under the agreement, goods originating in ASEAN have applied a 0-5 percent tariff rate.
As a member of ASEAN, it is part of the bloc’s free trade area and agreements with Australia, New Zealand, China, Indian, Japan, and South Korea. Indonesia also has a bilateral economic partnership agreement (EPA) with Japan and FTAs with Pakistan and the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement⟨93⟩ on February 10, this year.
The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) free trade agreement, signed off on November 15, includes all ten ASEAN countries, along with Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea. It is the world’s largest FTA, covering about 30 percent of global domestic products and nearly one-third of the global population.

### Double Tax Avoidance Agreements
In addition to its FTAs, Indonesia has a vast network of double tax agreements (DTAs), totaling 71 jurisdictions. The country has DTAs with Australia, New Zealand, the US, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, and many EU states, among others.
Double Tax Avoidance Agreements treaties effectively eliminate double taxation by identifying exemptions or reducing the amount of taxes payable in Vietnam.

## Competitive Corporate Income Tax rates, Incentives for doing business
The Indonesian government offers numerous investment-related business incentives and is continually making further improvements through reforms and by further upgrading its incentives to maintain the country’s high appeal to foreign investors. Among all investment incentives, tax incentives tend to be one of the most important to foreign investors and one of the most attractive features of the Indonesian business landscape.
Corporate income tax (CIT) incentives are granted investors, to promote investment in sectors or areas that are on par with the national development strategies. There are two main CIT incentives in Indonesia—preferential tax rates (reduced tax rates), and tax holidays (tax exempted for a certain period or the lifetime of the project).
Certain priority sectors for investment offer various tax exemptions. These include industries which the government prioritizes, companies that invest a certain amount in one of the 246 priority business lines will be afforded fiscal and non-fiscal incentives.
Tax incentives are also provided for investments in labor-intensive industries, training programs, and R&D.
Indonesia aims to make its special economic zones (SEZs) a policy priority to attract foreign investment, boost industrial activity, and promote job creation. This strategy has been further facilitated through various incentive programs available throughout the special economic zones in Indonesia, such as:
  * Exemption on corporate income tax
  * Corporate income tax allowance
  * Exemption on Import and excise duties
  * Exemption of VAT and sales tax on luxury goods

## Sound economy
Indonesia's economy grew 5.31% in 2022 year-on-year – the highest in the last 9 years. This further highlights the country’s increasingly strong position as Southeast Asia's largest economy with growth returning to pre-pandemic levels with the government easing COVID restrictions.
The International Monetary Fund in its World Economic Outlook update projected a 4.8% growth for Indonesia's economy and the World Bank also predicts that Indonesia will be one of the six countries that will account for more than half of all global growth by 2025, the others being China, Russia, India, Brazil, and South Korea.

## Domestic market, large workforce, and improving market liberalization
Indonesia has favorable conditions for labor-intensive manufacturing. Indonesia is the world’s fourth most populous country – with a population of over 272 million – offering foreign investors a vast labor pool. In contrast to China, which is rapidly aging, Indonesia’s demographics skew is young: the country’s median age is 29, and 60 percent of the population is under the age of 40.
Wages in Indonesia are fairly low, though there is considerable variation across regions – the highest in the Special Capital Region of Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital and largest city, at IDR 4,901,798 (US$316) per month and lowest in the Special Region of Yogyakarta are IDR 1,981,782 (US$128).
This minimum wage remains competitive when compared with China – where it ranges from US$400 per month in Shanghai to US$226 in Guangxi.
Indonesia’s middle-class has been growing faster than other groups, with at least 52 million Indonesians now considered economically secure; or one in five. The middle-class now represents close to half of household consumption in the country compared to just 12 percent in 2002. As such, Indonesia’s economy is primarily driven by domestic activity, giving it an advantage during the global financial crisis in 2008 as well as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
The expansion of this group will be key to unlocking Indonesia’s developmental potential. The middle-class is expected to reach 90 million by 2030 and some additional US$1.1 trillion in business opportunities. This led to increasing urbanization and some 56 percent of the Indonesia’s total population live in urban areas and cities.
Did You Know
Indonesia already has the world’s fourth largest population and will enjoy a demographic bonus until 2030, when the share of the population in working ages will be at its highest level and thus the potential for increased output per capita. This is compared to its peers Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand who are experiencing an ageing population.
Further, the most notable change to doing business in Indonesia is the introduction of the ‘positive investment list’. The general principle under the positive investment list is that a business sector is open to 100 percent foreign investment unless it is subjected to a specific type of limitation.
## New emerging sectors – Indonesia’s digital economy
Digital technology will play a leading role in Indonesia in reforming key sectors like healthcare and manufacturing in addition to improving the country’s resilience to disasters like the COVID-19 pandemic.
A 2020 report conducted by Google, Temasek Holdings, and Bain & Company concluded that Indonesia’s digital economy is expected to be valued at US$124 billion by 2025, largely powered by e-commerce, online travel, ride hailing, and online media. This will be facilitated by the country’s vibrant technology sector, supported by one of the highest concentration of startups in the world. There are currently over 2,100 startups in Indonesia, which is preceded only by the US, India, UK, and Canada. From this large number, five have achieved unicorn status and one is a decacorn.

Indonesia is Southeast Asia’s largest and fastest-growing internet economy – more than 215 million Indonesians had access to the internet in 2023, with 10 percent engaging in online shopping.
E-commerce is the driving force behind the transformation of Indonesia’s retail landscape, and the country’s gross merchandise value (GMV) was the third highest in the world at US$40 billion, beating India at US$38 billion.
Indonesia thus presents ample and scalable digital opportunities for foreign investors, particularly in e-commerce, fintech, and the Internet of Things (IoT). In trying to fully capitalize on this growth potential, Indonesia’s government issued new digital and e-commerce tax laws in 2020, a sign of the improving regulatory landscape.
This presents unique opportunities for foreign businesses in entering the country’s retail market. Notable foreign e-commerce platforms that have taken advantage of Indonesia’s large consumer market are Singapore’s Lazada and Shopee, as well as the recently merged Tokopedia and Gojek – creating Indonesia’s largest digital services company.
### Financial technology
Indonesia’s fintech industry is one of the most competitive and dynamic in ASEAN as evidenced by the emergence of four unicorns and one decacorn in the industry. The country is home to 20 percent of all fintech companies in the Southeast Asian bloc, which is expected to generate US$8.6 billion in revenues over the next five years, despite its infancy.
The fintech industry is one of the most funded sectors — along with e-commerce — and is dominated by peer-to-peer (P2P) lending (50 percent) and e-payment (23 percent) platforms. Despite having more than 300 fintech companies operating in Indonesia, foreign investors will find the industry has yet to fulfil its potential. One of the factors is that 60 percent of the country’s workforce is in the informal sector, and many micro, small, and medium sized enterprises (MSMEs) have little access to financing from banks, as they too are mostly operating in the informal sector.
#### P2P lending
Many local MSMEs have business models that are not compatible with the characteristics of the banks’ financial products. That includes aspects such as payment terms for loan schemes, forms of collateral, and credit quality, among others.
Foreign fintech firms can plug this gap through new financing models that have the potential to serve Indonesia’s approximately 45 million underbanked and 90 million unbanked adults.
These microloans are popular because of their convenience as it normally takes just 24 hours for the funds to be disbursed, and the terms and maturity are small and short – with borrowers typically receiving not more than US$100. These are normally returned within a few weeks as there are often huge interest charges.

#### E-wallets
Electronic money transactions rose by 173 percent in 2020 and have become indispensable to Indonesian consumers. The country is predicted to be the next battleground for digital payment apps, with Indonesia possessing many of the key characteristics that are critical for the adoption of digital payment systems.
As of 2022, some 224 million people had access to the internet, expected to rise to 270 million by 2028. Further, the smartphone penetration rate stood at approximately 80 percent. Moreover, the middle-class now comprises 20 percent of the population, a key segment in the growth of the digital economy.
Local players still dominate the market, however, for foreign investors in the e-wallet industry, it is essential that they deliver a customer-centric experience to allow customers to pay with the local payment method of their choice, ranging from mobile banking to payments via convenience stores. This is because while Indonesia has a high smartphone penetration rate, a sizeable portion of its population is unbanked.
### Cloud technology and big data analytics
Indonesia is embracing cloud technology at speed and scale and has attracted investments from the world’s largest tech companies. In a report compiled by the Boston Consulting Group, Indonesia’s public cloud market is projected to see a compound annual growth rate of 25 percent — to reach US$800 million by 2023. The growing number of digital natives and the expansion of digital unicorns is fast turning Indonesia into one of Asia-Pacific’s fastest-growing public cloud markets.
Alibaba gained a first-mover advantage over rivals Google, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft.
The management of big data will be key to maximizing the future of Indonesia’s cloud technology industry. Big data will be of great importance in understanding consumer trends in the country, particularly in recording digital footprints through social media platforms. Many MSMEs are using Facebook and Instagram to reach their consumer base.
There were 191.4 million social media users in Indonesia in January 2022. With 129.9 million Facebook users, 99.15 million Instagram users, and 92,07 million TikTok users.
It is estimated that the total number of social network users will reach 256 million by 2025.

# Economic Indicators and Indonesia's GDP, FDI, and Trade Trends
## Gross Domestic Product growth and forecast
Indonesia’s central bank, Bank Indonesia, predicts that the country’s economy is expected to grow at between 4.5-5.3 percent in 2023 – one of the highest among G20 members – and will be supported by several important sectors, including commodities, infrastructure development, tourism, and manufacturing of high-value products, such as electric vehicle batteries.
  

Contributing Advisor
GDP had accelerated to 5.31 percent in 2022, bringing Southeast Asia’s largest economy back to pre-pandemic growth. The pace of growth in 2022 was largely supported by Indonesia’s large domestic consumption and further bolstered by the export of commodities as global prices of key shipments, such as coal, palm oil, and iron, rallied upwards.
Indonesia saw a breakthrough year in 2022 and recorded some US$43 billion in FDI⟨92⟩, the highest in the country’s history.
The highest priority for the Indonesian government for 2023 will be to hold inflation at three percent. Further, weakening global economic activity and a slowdown in commodity prices could impact GDP this year. However, external demand for commodities and pent-up domestic consumption will continue to be the backbone of growth in 2023.
## Foreign Direct Investment trends
Foreign direct investment into Indonesia (excluding investment in banking and the oil and gas sectors) increased 20.2 percent year-on-year to a new record peak of IDR 177 trillion (US$ 11.96 billion) in the first quarter of 2023, amid efforts by the government to ease business and licensing rules.
Singapore (US$ 4.3 billion) was the biggest source of investment, followed by Hong Kong (US$ 1.5 billion), China (US$ 1.2 billion), and Japan (US$ 1 billion) while base metals were the biggest recipient amid efforts to boost investment in processed minerals.
In total, Indonesia recorded IDR 328.9 trillion (US$ 22.4 billion) of foreign and domestic investment during the first quarter, up 16.5 percent from a year earlier, boosted by a rise in investment in base metals, transportation, and the mining sector. For 2023, the government has set a target to draw IDR 1,400 trillion (US$ 95.5 billion) of investment from domestic and foreign sources.
According to the Indonesian Investment Coordinating Board, or the BKPM, Indonesia received US$43 billion in foreign investment in 2022, the highest in the country’s history and an increase of 44 percent from 2021. When combined with domestic investments, Indonesia saw 1,207 trillion rupiah (US$80 billion) in investments, an increase of 34 percent from the previous year.
Foreign investment in Indonesia in 2022 was dominated by the metal mining and mining sectors, which saw more than US$16 billion in FDI combined.
For 2023, the government is expecting 1,400 trillion rupiah (US$92 billion) in combined foreign and domestic investments, and 1,650 trillion rupiah (US$108 billion) in 2024.
## Indonesia’s import and export statistics
Indonesia is rich in natural resources - including crude oil, natural gas, tin, copper, and gold. This also constitutes the bulk of Indonesian exports. Machinery and equipment, chemicals, fuels, and foodstuffs are among the most valuable imported goods.
Data from Statistics Indonesia (BPS) recorded 2022 exports worth US$291.98 billion, an increase of 26.07 per cent year-on-year. Imports in 2022 were valued at US$237.52 billion, an increase of 21.07 per cent year-on-.A commodities-led export boom has helped Indonesia’s post-pandemic recovery. However, economic momentum is expected to slow down as commodity prices ease and global monetary policy changes hits demand.
Total exports reached US$ 23.8 billion in December 2022. Further, exports decreased in April of 2023 to US$ 19.29 billion, a 15-month low, from US$ 23416.90 million in March 2023.
Indonesia’s major export partners in 2022:
  * China 23.31%
  * ASEAN 19.07%
  * United States 11.75%
  * European Union 8.16%
  * Japan 7.70%
  * India 5.96%
  * South Korea 3.63%
  * Hong Kong 3.01%


In the long-term, the Indonesia Exports is projected to trend at a monthly average of US$16 billion in 2023 and (US$17.7 billion in 2024.
## Indonesia’s import statistics
In January 2023, imports to Indonesia increased by 1.27 percent year on year to US$ 18.44 billion. However, imports to Indonesia started to decline in the following months, missing the market forecasts.
Imports to Indonesia fell by:
  * 32 percent YoY to USD 15.92 billion in February 2023;
  * 26 percent YoY to USD 20.59 billion in March 2023; and
  * 32 percent YoY to USD 15.35 billion in April 2023.

Long term forecasts for Indonesian imports are expected to trend at IDR 203550.20 million (US$14 billion) in 2023. 
### Indonesia’s major import partners in 2022:
  * China 32.66%
  * ASEAN 17.17%
  * Japan 8.56%
  * European Union 6.43%
  * South Korea 5.23%
  * United States 5.09%
  * Australia 4.96%
  * India 3.97%

# Why Invest in Indonesia
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/why-indonesia)
Over the past few decades, Indonesia has developed into a vibrant democracy with the largest and most dynamic economy in Southeast Asia. Now a member of the G20, the country offers foreign investors growth potential for those seeking long-term commitments, given its status as the largest economy in ASEAN (and 16th largest in the world), with a young workforce, and a rapidly expanding middle-class.
  

Contributing Advisor
The Indonesian government has vowed to continue implementing prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms to further enhance the ease of doing business and improve the country’s investment climate, as well as to support the New Capital Nusantara project. This included issuing various tax incentives as well as widening the number of positions open to expatriate workers.
Amidst these conditions, specific trends are also driving further increases in the country’s inbound investment, and making Indonesia a hotbed for companies from around the world that are seeking to:
  * Diversify their Asia presence;
  * Access the ASEAN and South Asia markets;
  * Supplement their China operations; and
  * Leverage increasingly attractive free trade agreements, business incentives, and market advantages.


Many businesses are turning to Indonesia as a second Asia investment option for certain types of consumer-related market opportunities such as retail, health, and financial services. Recent global supply chain and trade shocks, as well as higher costs of labor have propelled Indonesia as a viable option for a China+1 strategy. The country boasts an enormous labor pool, a growing middle class, and a vast wealth of natural resources. Standard Chartered Bank projected Indonesia’s economy to grow from US$4.2 trillion in 2020 to US$10.1 trillion by 2030 to become the world’s fourth-largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity.
For foreign investors looking to complement operations in China, Indonesia offers an immense market with substantial room for continued growth.
![incentives and facilities available in indonesian SEZ⟨93⟩]
### Ease of doing business
Indonesia has consistently improved its ease of doing business (EODB) ranking by improving the business environment in the country. In recent years the country has improved its rank by implementing various regulatory measures for:
  * Starting a business — it is now easier since the introduction of an online platform for business licensing, which issues electronic certificates.
  * Paying taxes — the country has made paying taxes simpler due to the online filing and payment system for major taxes.
  * Enforcing contracts — it is now managed through an online case management system for judges designed to streamline the filing, and delivery of court documents.
  * Trading across barriers — it has improved because of the online processing of export customs, enabling more efficient and cost-effective cross-border trade.
  * Getting electricity — it is now easier for businesses due to renovations and upgrade maintenance to its electrical grids.


## Indonesia’s international free trade and tax agreements
### Free Trade Agreements
As an autonomous market and a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Indonesia has signed and executed a number of free trade agreements with countries and regions all over the world. This includes the (ASEAN) Free Trade Area and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership; two of the largest FTA in the world.
The (ASEAN) Free Trade Area (AFTA) was signed in 1992 with the aim to be a catalyst to help ASEAN become a production base for global markets. Under the agreement, goods originating in ASEAN have applied a 0-5 percent tariff rate.
As a member of ASEAN, it is part of the bloc’s free trade area and agreements with Australia, New Zealand, China, India, Japan, and South Korea. Indonesia also has a bilateral economic partnership agreement (EPA) with Japan and FTAs with Pakistan and the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement⟨94⟩ on February 10, this year.
The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) free trade agreement, signed off on November 15, includes all ten ASEAN countries, along with Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea. It is the world’s largest FTA, covering about 30 percent of global domestic products and nearly one-third of the global population.

### Double Tax Avoidance Agreements
In addition to its FTAs, Indonesia has a vast network of double tax agreements (DTAs), totaling 71 jurisdictions. The country has DTAs with Australia, New Zealand, the US, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India, and many EU states, among others.
Double Tax Avoidance Agreements treaties effectively eliminate double taxation by identifying exemptions or reducing the amount of taxes payable in Indonesia.

## Why companies relocate to Indonesia
Indonesia is the 10th largest economy in the world based on purchasing power parity (PPP) and the fourth largest in East Asia – after China, Japan, and South Korea. By 2030, Indonesia’s robust economic development is expected to transform the country into the world’s seventh-largest economy.
Did You Know
Indonesia’s government is eyeing long-term reforms to improve its bureaucracy and investment environment. This includes introducing the Job Creation Law, also known as the Omnibus Law in 2020 which opened up more sectors for foreign ownership, preparing new labor laws, and simplifying business licenses, among others.
To size up Indonesia, or any country, as a potential destination for relocation, it is vital that foreign investors diligently research their options across many factors that are relevant to their situation. Such factors may include infrastructure, locations, talent availability, access to raw materials, incentives, supply chain partners and logistics, and others.
Here are some top reasons why companies choose to relocate to Indonesia:
  * All of the stated Top Reasons to Invest in Indonesia⟨95⟩.
  * Indonesia’s continuous track record of high growth, relative to other low-cost countries.
  * The country’s ongoing business reforms aid foreign investors.
  * A growing number of special economic zones, workforce and labor availability, lower labor costs and an increasingly open environment for foreign direct investments.
  * Indonesia is a “China plus one” destination for dealing with rising costs in China and unpredictable scenarios such as trade shocks. Foreign investors may look at Indonesia to supplement their China operations for its lower-cost inputs, alternate markets, and as a gateway to the ASEAN and South Asia markets.

## Ongoing business reforms
In 2020, Indonesia’s government enacted the job creation law – commonly known as the Omnibus Law. The law and its implementing regulations have been heralded for introducing the most significant reforms in Indonesia’s history in a range of areas including investment, employment, business licensing, immigration, and environmental standards, among others.

The Omnibus Law amended more than 75 current laws to simplify licensing processes and the harmonization of regulations to increase the ease of doing business and enable the central government to respond faster to global changes or challenges.
The most notable change to doing business is the introduction of the ‘positive investment list’. The general principle under the positive investment list is that a business sector is open to 100 percent foreign investment unless it is subjected to a specific type of limitation. The regulation presents one of the greatest liberalizations in foreign ownership limitations in Indonesia since the negative investment list was first introduced in the 1980s.
Important sectors that had previous foreign ownership restrictions, which have now been lifted include, among others:
  * Telecommunications;
  * Transportation;
  * Energy;
  * Distribution; and
  * Construction services.


Another significant reform act is the risk-based approach to the issuance of business licenses. Business licenses will now be issued based on the assessment of the ‘business risk level’ determined by the scale of hazards a business can potentially create.
To determine the risk level, the government will conduct a risk analysis of each application before deciding on issuing a business license. This will comprise of:
  * Identifying the relevant business activity;
  * Assessing the hazard level;
  * Assessing the potential occurrence of hazards;
  * Determining the risk level and business scale rating; and
  * Determining the type of business license.


Based on the aforementioned risk analysis, the business activities undertaken by the applicant company will be classified into one of the following risk-level types:
  * Low-risk businesses;
  * Medium-low risk businesses;
  * Medium-high risk businesses; and
  * High-risk businesses.


Based on this risk-based approach, the lower the business risk, the simpler the business licensing requirements will be.
The government will undertake the risk analysis for business activities in the following sectors:
  * Maritime affairs and fisheries;
  * Agriculture;
  * The environment and forestry;
  * Energy and mineral resources;
  * Nuclear energy;
  * Industry;
  * Trading;
  * Public works and housing;
  * Transport;
  * Health, medicine, and food;
  * Education and culture;
  * Tourism;
  * Religious affairs;
  * Post, telecommunications, broadcasting, and electronic system, and transactions;
  * Defense; and
  * Employment

## Incentives, workforce, and economic zones
### Incentives for doing business in Indonesia
The Indonesian government offers numerous investment-related business incentives and is continually making further improvements through reforms and by further upgrading its incentives to maintain the country’s high appeal to foreign investors. Among all investment incentives, tax incentives tend to be one of the most important to foreign investors and one of the most attractive features of the Indonesian business landscape.
#### Tax incentives
Corporate income tax (CIT) incentives are granted to investors, to promote investment in sectors or areas that are on par with the national development strategies. There are two main CIT incentives in Indonesia—preferential tax rates (reduced tax rates), and tax holidays (tax exempted for a certain period or the lifetime of the project).
Certain priority sectors for investment offer various tax exemptions. These include industries which the government prioritizes, companies that invest a certain amount in one of the 246 priority business lines will be afforded fiscal and non-fiscal incentives.
Tax incentives are also provided for investments in labor-intensive industries, training programs, and R&D.
Indonesia aims to make its special economic zones (SEZs) a policy priority to attract foreign investment, boost industrial activity, and promote job creation. This strategy has been further facilitated through various incentive programs available throughout the special economic zones in Indonesia, such as:
  * Exemption on corporate income tax
  * Corporate income tax allowance
  * Exemption on Import and excise duties
  * Exemption of VAT and sales tax on luxury goods

Corporate Income Tax Holidays for Special Economic Zones in Indonesia  
---  
Taxpayer |  Investment amount |  Concession period (years)  
Business entity |  100 billion rupiah (US$7 million) |  10  
Businessperson |  Between 100 billion rupiah (US$7 million) to 500 billion rupiah (US$35 million) |  10  
Between 500 billion rupiah (US$35 million) to 1 trillion rupiah (US$70 million) |  15  
More than 1 trillion rupiah (US$70 million) |  20  
### Special Economic Zones
Indonesia has SEZs designed to attract foreign investment. Indonesia currently has 20 SEZs dispersed from the west to the east of Indonesia.
Compared to other areas in Indonesia, SEZs boast higher-quality infrastructure, special tax incentives, streamlined regulations, customs exemptions, and the accelerated issuance of work visas.
Many SEZs also promote industry clustering, such as Batam Island’s new digital park and central Java’s export-oriented automotive SEZ. Each SEZ was selected for its accessibility to local resources and thus serves specialized industries.
Specific incentives vary depending on the SEZ, industry, and size of investment.

### ASEAN’s largest labor market
Indonesia is the world’s fourth most populous country (275.7 million) with a young demographic averaging 30 years of age. Additionally, 60 percent of the population is under the age of 40. This makes Indonesia ASEAN’s largest labor market with over 130 million workers and the fourth largest labor market in the world.
The country’s current stage of development makes it ideal for labor-intensive manufacturing and the country is already a prominent producer of garments and textiles in addition to automobiles.
Despite its large labor market, only 55 million workers are considered ‘skilled’ and productivity is relatively low compared to its ASEAN counterparts. The government predicts that Indonesia will require 100 million skilled workers by 2030 as it aims to become the world’s fourth-largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity. To encourage this human capital development, the government is offering businesses tax incentives for those establishing apprenticeships or training programs that foreign businesses can leverage when doing business in Indonesia.
Indonesia has also one of the region’s lowest wage rates and every province sets its own minimum wage.
## Indonesia’s natural resource availability
Indonesia has an abundance of natural resources ranging from coal, silver, gold, nickel, copper, bauxite, thermal coal, tin, petroleum, and natural gas, among others. Mining, including oil and gas extraction, contributes to one-tenth of GDP as well as the country’s foreign exchange earnings.
In addition to hydrocarbon reserves, Indonesia’s mineral resources also contribute significantly to the economy. The country is the world’s largest producer of tin in addition to accounting for roughly 30 percent of the world’s nickel production ahead of Australia and Brazil. Indonesia produced 16.769 metric tons of nickel in the Q1 of 2023.
Further, Indonesia’s Grasberg mine has the second-largest reserve of copper in the world as well as the world’s largest reserve of gold.
### Indonesia FDI Realization Recap 2023
In 2023, Indonesia witnessed significant progress in its Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) realization. The government set an ambitious target to attract IDR 1,400 trillion (about US$ 95.5 billion) in combined foreign and domestic investments for the year, aiming to sustain the growth momentum from the previous year when it recorded US$ 43 billion in FDI, marking the highest in the country's history.
Indonesia received a total of approximately IDR 1,418,9 trillion (US$ billion) in investments (both foreign and domestic) during the period from January to December 2023. Of this total, an estimated IDR 744 trillion (US$ billion) came from 
The following countries were the primary sources of foreign investment in Indonesia from January to December 2023:
  * Singapore: US$15.4 billion.
  * China: US$7.4 billion.
  * Hong Kong: US$6.5 billion.
  * Japan: US$4.6 billion.
  * Malaysia: US$4.1 billion


Here's an industry-centric comparison table that encapsulates the FDI investments across various sectors in Indonesia for 2023, highlighting significant areas of growth and strategic focus:
![indonesia fdi realization 2023⟨97⟩]
## Industries driving Indonesia’s economy
### Mining and petroleum
Indonesia’s mining and petroleum industries have been the backbone of the country’s economy since the 1970s. Primary commodities accounted for about 60 percent of total exports. Despite Indonesia trying to climb up the value production chain, commodities are set to continue to dominate exports for the next 10 years, with China and India replacing the US and Japan as the top export destinations.
### Manufacturing
Indonesia is keen to diversify and develop its manufacturing sector and transform its low-value manufacturing capabilities into more high-value products. The sector currently contributes to 20 percent of GDP with the country aiming to increase this to 25 percent of GDP by 2030, turning Indonesia into a manufacturing hub by 2030 that rivals Germany and South Korea. The government hopes this can be achieved through developing the automotive industries, chemical manufacturing, and electronics through the Making Indonesia 4.0 roadmap.
Did You Know
Indonesia’s manufacturing sector employs approximately 15 percent of the total workforce.
The main areas of production are food and beverages, textiles, electronics, automotive, footwear, and textiles and garments. An estimated 99 percent of the manufacturers are micro, small, or medium enterprises (MSMEs), which account for two-thirds of total employment in manufacturing.
 Also Read⟨20⟩ Read more about Indonesia's manufacturing sector in this guide.⟨20⟩
### Services
The country’s services sector is the largest source of job creation, forming over 45 percent of total employment and some 45 percent of total GDP. Tourism and hospitality are some of the biggest sub-sectors and demand for hotels and other accommodations will continue to rise significantly as more tourists and businesspeople visit the country.
Aviation is another promising industry. Indonesia is a major importer of civilian aircraft and their parts, a vital market for suppliers from countries such as the US. The country has the second-fastest-growing aviation industry in the world behind China. More than 350 million people are expected to fly to and from Indonesia by 2036, making it the world’s fourth-largest air travel market.
Indonesia’s healthcare industry is another lucrative investment opportunity for foreign investors as the growth of its middle class and the introduction of universal healthcare has driven demand in almost all aspects of the industry from hospitals to pharmaceuticals to medical devices. Indonesia introduced its universal healthcare program, the JKN, in 2014, which has since grown into the world’s largest, covering over 200 million people.
### Agriculture
Agriculture continues to play an integral role in the economy, employing one-third of the country’s total workforce. The sector consists of small-scale farming and large commercial plantations for a variety of products such as rice, rubber, palm oil, tropical fruits, nutmeg, cocoa, and coffee. The country is aiming to achieve food self-sufficiency by 2045.
### Digital economy
Indonesia’s digital economy has seen exponential growth over the last few years and is expected to be valued at US$124 billion by 2025. An increasingly prosperous, tech-savvy consumer demographic is reshaping the way the nation consumes, creating a wealth of opportunities for foreign investors.
The e-commerce industry will be the main driver of the digital economy, which is set to be worth over US$83 billion by 2025. In addition, there are other untapped, scalable opportunities, bringing the government closer to its target of building the largest digital economy in Southeast Asia.
An array of foreign tech giants, from Google to Amazon to Facebook, have already invested in Indonesia’s digital landscape, attracted not only by the long-term potential but the government’s ongoing efforts to develop much much-needed regulatory framework.

### Infrastructure
The Indonesian government announced an ambitious infrastructure plan worth US$350 billion in 2014-2019. The government intends to spend another US$400 billion on infrastructure projects across the country.
This includes developing 25 new airports, waste-to-energy facilities, as well as mass transit projects. The government will also build 2,600 km (1,600 miles) of new highways and construct 35,000 MW of electricity plants. Further, the construction of the new capital city on the island of Borneo began in 2021, which is set to cost US$33 billion.
Some 40 percent of the cost of these projects will be funded by the government, 25 percent through state-owned companies, and the rest from the private sector.

# Complete Guide to Individual Income Tax Filing in Indonesia 
[](https://www.aseanbriefing.com/doing-business-guide/indonesia/taxation-and-accounting/individual-income-tax-filing)
Understanding the individual income tax⟨59⟩ filing process in Indonesia is essential for compliance and efficient financial management. Through understanding and adherence to the following guidelines, individuals can ensure they meet their tax obligations effectively, avoiding legal complications and optimizing their financial planning.
  

Contributing Advisor
## Tax residency
Tax residency in Indonesia is a key concept that significantly influences one's tax obligations. Residents are subject to taxation on their worldwide income, which highlights the importance of understanding one's residency status to effectively manage tax liabilities.
### Residency status criteria
  * Presence in Indonesia for over 183 days in a year.
  * Having a habitual place of residence that is consistently accessible, not merely a transit location.
  * Demonstrating vital personal and economic ties to Indonesia.
  * Possession of documents like permanent or limited stay permits ⟨63⟩to substantiate residency intent.


#### Foreigners’ residents’ taxation
Upon establishing tax residency, foreigners are subject to tax on all income sourced within Indonesia⟨56⟩ with the following details:
  * Foreigners meeting residency criteria are taxed on all income sourced within Indonesia.
  * Eligibility for territorial taxation for the first four years of residency, limiting tax liability to Indonesian-sourced income.
  * Qualification for territorial tax requires specific skills and a commitment to transferring knowledge to Indonesian citizens.


### Exempted individuals
Certain categories of foreign expatriates are not classified as Indonesian tax residents, despite potentially spending extensive periods within the country.

This status effectively exempts them from paying Personal Income Tax (PIT) even if they fulfill the general criteria of residency based on the duration of their stay or their intent to reside in Indonesia.
The specific groups that benefit from these exemptions include:
  * **Foreign Diplomatic and Consular Personnel** : Individuals in these roles are typically exempt from tax obligations in the host country as per international diplomatic laws and agreements.
  * **Military Personnel and Civilian Employees of Foreign Armed Services** : This group consists of individuals serving in the military or as civilian staff within foreign armed forces, exempted under various defense and bilateral agreements.
  * **Representatives of International Organizations** : This exemption applies to individuals working for international bodies, such as the United Nations or the World Bank, as specified by the Minister of Finance or through international treaties⟨7⟩ to which Indonesia is a signatory.


These exemptions aim to facilitate international cooperation and respect the sovereign legal frameworks established through global and bilateral agreements⟨8⟩.
## Taxable income overview
### Taxable and non-taxable income types
Taxable income in Indonesia includes a variety of earnings such as:
  * Employment income;
  * Dividends (both onshore and offshore);
  * Interest income;
  * Royalties;
  * Rental income from property (again, both onshore and offshore); and,
  * Capital gains from the sale or transfer of assets.


Notably, resident taxpayers with a gross revenue of not more than IDR 4.8 million (USD 299) from certain business activities can opt for a 0.5% final income tax rate calculated from the gross revenue.
Conversely, certain types of income **are not typically taxable**. For example:
  * In-kind benefits provided by employers like; 
    * Housing;
    * Food and beverages;
    * Gifts for religious holidays and other events;
    * Health, security, and safety benefits;
    * Vehicle facilities;
    * Work equipment;
    * Sports facilities; and,
    * Employer’s contribution to employee pension funds.


These benefits, however, **are not tax-deductible for the employer and could be subject to tax under specific conditions**.
Additionally, capital gains from the sale of **land or buildings in Indonesia are taxed at a final rate of 5%** on the higher of the taxable sale value⟨54⟩ or actual proceeds, and the sale of shares traded on the Indonesia Stock Exchange incurs a 0.1% final tax on sales proceeds.

## Tax rates and brackets
### Progressive tax rates for residents
The tax structure for residents is progressive, meaning that the rate of taxation increases as the taxable income increases. This system is designed to ensure fairness, with higher-income earners paying a higher percentage of their income in taxes. The specific brackets for resident taxpayers are as follows:
Personal Income Tax Rates in Indonesia  
---  
Annual income |  Rate (%)  
Up to 60 million rupiah (US$3,869) |  5%  
Above 60 million rupiah (US$3,883) to 250 million rupiah (US$16,120) |  15%  
Above 250 million (US$16,120) to 500 million rupiah (US$32,239) |  25%  
Above 500 million rupiah (US$32,239) to 5 billion rupiah (US$323, 000) |  30%  
Above 5 billion rupiah (US$322,395) |  35%  
These rates apply to the annual taxable income, following a self-assessment system where taxpayers calculate their tax due based on these brackets. The monthly withholding tax from January to November is calculated using an Effective Tax Rate (ETR), while the annual reconciliation in December applies these progressive rates.
The ETR is calculated based on the individual’s gross monthly income or an individual’s daily income. Here is a comprehensive table that breaks down the taxpayer categories and their respective Effective Tax Rates (ETR) for both monthly and daily income scenarios in Indonesia:
Taxpayer Category |  Monthly ETR Description  
---|---  
Category A | 
  * Single with no dependent (S/0)
  * Single with one dependent (S/1)
  * Married with no dependent (M/0)

  
Category B | 
  * Single with two dependents (S/2)
  * Single with three dependents (S/3)
  * Married with one dependent (M/1)
  * Married with two dependents (M/2)

  
Category C |  Married with three dependents (M/3)  
Daily Income Level (IDR) |  Daily ETR  
---|---  
Up to 450,000 |  0% (Zero percent income tax rate)  
Above 450,000 to 2,500,000 |  0.5% (Tax rate for daily income)  
This table outlines the categorization and corresponding ETR applied to different family statuses for monthly taxed employees and shows the specific tax rates applicable to non-permanent employees⟨46⟩ who are paid daily. The rates aim to reflect the financial responsibility towards dependents in a progressive manner.

### Flat tax rates for non-residents
Non-residents in Indonesia are subject to a different tax regime compared to residents. **A flat rate of 20 percent is imposed on their gross income** , regardless of the amount. This simplifies the tax calculation for individuals who do not reside in Indonesia but earn income from Indonesian sources.
Specific exceptions include income from the sale of shares in Indonesian companies and certain assets, which **are taxed at a final rate of 5 percent on the sales proceeds**.
## Deductions and allowances
Various deductions are available from the gross income when calculating an individual's annual taxable income in Indonesia. Families are treated as a single tax reporting entity, represented by a single tax identification number (NPWP) held by the family head, who must include the income of their dependent spouse and children in their tax returns.
### Employer obligations
Most income tax is collected through employer withholding⟨56⟩, which must then be remitted monthly to the appropriate governmental body⟨74⟩.
Income Tax Deductions in Indonesia  
---  
Basic of deduction |  Deductible amount per year  
Individual taxpayer |  54 million rupiah (US$3,482)  
Spouse |  Additional 4.5 million rupiah (US$290)  
Each dependent (max. 3) |  Additional 4.5 million rupiah (US$290)  
### Employee obligations
  * **Annual tax return** : Expatriate employees in Indonesia must file their tax return and calculate their tax liability by March 31 of the following year.
  * **Statutory withholdings** : The majority of Personal Income Tax (PIT) is paid through employer withholdings on earned income.
  * **Provisional tax payments** : For any additional regular income, taxpayers must make monthly provisional tax payments to the tax department, based on the previous year's earnings.

## Tax return filing process
In Indonesia, taxpayers have the option to file their tax returns either digitally through the e-filing system or using traditional paper forms. The table below provides the highlighted difference between both methods.
### Digital vs. paper filing
Feature |  Digital Filing |  Paper Filing  
---|---|---  
Method |  e-Filing system |  Submission of physical forms  
Convenience |  High - Can be done from anywhere with internet |  Lower - Requires physical submission  
Processing speed |  Faster - Immediate processing and confirmation |  Slower - Depends on manual processing  
Submission confirmation |  Immediate confirmation of receipt |  Delayed confirmation, depending on the processing  
Registration required |  Yes - Need to obtain an Electronic Filing Identification Number (eFIN) |  No registration is required for filing, but eFIN needed for some service points  
How to obtain eFin |  Can be obtained online or at the local tax office by providing the required documents |  Not applicable  
Submission methods |  Online through the tax authority’s official portal |  Direct to the tax office, postal, courier, or tax service points  
Popularity |  Increasingly preferred due to convenience |  Less common, but still used, especially in areas with limited internet access  
### Step-by-step guide
Filing an individual income tax return in Indonesia involves several key steps to note. The following steps are:
#### Step 1: Initial preparation
Taxpayers start by gathering all necessary documentation required for filing the tax return. This includes:
  * Tax payment slips to demonstrate that all due taxes have been paid;
  * A copy of the Employer’s Certificate of Income Tax on Earnings (Form 1721 – A1);
  * A detailed list of liabilities and assets; and,
  * For foreign income, any supporting documents for foreign tax paid.


#### Step 2: Payment verification
Before submission, it is essential to ensure that all tax liabilities for the fiscal year have been settled. This step is critical to avoid any penalties for underpayment which could complicate the tax filing process.
#### Step 3: Form completion and submission timing
The tax return must account for all income and deductions for the fiscal year running from January 1 to December 31. Taxpayers are required to file their completed tax returns with the Tax Office no later than March 31 of the following year.
#### Step 4: Requesting an extension
If circumstances prevent timely filing, taxpayers have the option to request an extension. This is done by submitting Form 1770-Y, which extends the filing deadline to May 31.
It is important to note that while this form extends the filing deadline, it does not extend the deadline for tax payments, which remain due by March 31.
## Claiming tax credits and rebates
Personal tax residents have the opportunity to reduce their tax liability through various credits and rebates. These tax benefits are designed to reflect taxes already paid during the fiscal year and to avoid double taxation, especially for income earned abroad. Key domestic tax credits include:
  * The income tax withheld by employers on employment income;
  * Taxes collected on business income;
  * Withholding tax⟨56⟩ on other incomes that are not final in nature; and,
  * Provisional monthly tax instalments are made throughout the fiscal year.


Additionally, for income earned outside of Indonesia, foreign tax credits allow taxpayers to claim a credit for taxes paid to foreign governments, though this is capped at the total Indonesian income tax due on that foreign income.
### Step-by-step process for claiming tax credits
#### Gather documentation
The first step in claiming any tax credit is to compile all necessary documentation. This includes proof of income and corresponding tax payments, such as payment slips, tax withholding certificates from employers, and official receipts or statements from foreign tax authorities.
#### Complete the tax return form
When filling out your annual tax return, you will need to include detailed information on your income and the taxes paid both in Indonesia and abroad. Ensure that the form is completed accurately to include all relevant sections pertaining to tax credits.
#### Attach proof of tax paid
For both domestic and foreign tax credits, it's essential to attach proof of the tax paid. This could be in the form of withholding tax certificates, business income tax receipts, or official statements from foreign tax bodies.
#### File tax return by the due date
Submit your tax return by the March 31 deadline. If you're claiming foreign tax credits, make sure the calculations are accurate to avoid claiming more than what is due, as this could lead to discrepancies and possible audits.
#### Wait for assessment
Once submitted, your tax return will be assessed by the Directorate General of Taxes. During this period, ensure that you are available to respond to any queries or requests for additional documentation.
#### Receive confirmation
After processing, if all documentation and calculations are verified, the Directorate General of Taxes will confirm the amount of tax credit you are entitled to. This amount will then be applied against any tax due or potentially refunded if it exceeds your tax liability.
## Deadlines and key dates
Here is a comprehensive table outlining the key tax filing dates for individual taxpayers in Indonesia:
Event |  Date |  Description  
---|---|---  
Start of Fiscal Year |  January 1 |  The fiscal year for individual taxpayers begins.  
End of Fiscal Year |  December 31 |  The fiscal year for individual taxpayers ends.  
Deadline for Tax Payments |  March 31 |  All taxes due for the previous year must be paid by this date.  
Deadline for Tax Return Submission |  March 31 |  Tax returns must be submitted to ensure timely processing.  
Extension request deadline |  March 31 |  Last date to request an extension for filing tax returns.  
Extended Deadline for Filing Tax Returns |  May 31 |  Extended deadline to file tax returns if an extension was granted.  
Quarterly payments due |  15th day after each quarter ends |  For those making quarterly payments, due by the 15th day after the quarter ends.  
### Compliance and penalties
  * **Penalties for late submission** : Failing to meet tax filing or payment deadlines results in penalties. Late submissions incur an administrative fine of IDR 100,000 (US$ 6.18). Additionally, any taxes due that are paid late are subject to a monthly interest penalty. The interest tax rates vary depending on the month of the late payment, with the highest rate reaching 0,99%.
  * **Tax registration cancellation** : Expatriates leaving Indonesia should ensure that their tax registrations are properly cancelled to prevent being considered continuous tax residents, which involves a tax audit and submission of all relevant tax-related documents to the local tax office.
  * **Regular monitoring and updates** : Regularly checking the Directorate General of Taxes website or consulting with a tax advisor can provide updates on tax legislation and deadline changes, helping taxpayers stay informed and compliant.

# How to Set Up a Representative Office in the Philippines: A Guide for Foreign Investors
April 4, 2025 Posted by ASEAN Briefing⟨136⟩ Written by  Reading Time: **4 minutes**
A Representative Office in the Philippines serves as a non-commercial entity that allows foreign companies to establish a presence in the country without engaging in direct sales or revenue-generating activities. This structure is ideal for market research, supplier coordination, and quality control while maintaining full reliance on funding from the parent company.
Find Business Support
Unlike a branch or subsidiary, a Representative Office does not have a separate legal identity from its parent entity and cannot enter into contracts that generate income. However, it serves as a strategic entry point for companies assessing market conditions before committing to a larger investment.
## Key advantages and considerations
Establishing a Representative Office can be beneficial for companies seeking to explore the Philippine market while avoiding the complexities of commercial licensing and taxation. Some of the main advantages include:
  * Market exploration without commercial risks – Companies can conduct feasibility studies, gather industry insights, and build business relationships before making a full-scale investment.
  * Tax exemptions – Since a Representative Office does not engage in profit-generating activities, it is typically exempt from corporate income tax in the Philippines.
  * Lower regulatory burden – The setup process is relatively straightforward compared to subsidiaries or branches, with fewer ongoing compliance requirements.


However, businesses must also consider the limitations, such as the prohibition on revenue-generating activities and the requirement for full funding from the parent company.
## Preparing for establishment: Eligibility and requirements
Before initiating the registration process, foreign companies must assess their eligibility and meet the necessary qualifications. The Philippine government imposes the following criteria:
  * The parent company must be legally established in its home country and have an operational history of at least three years.
  * A minimum inward remittance of **US$ 30,000** is required to cover operational expenses.
  * The parent company must provide proof of financial stability to sustain operations in the Philippines.
  * Certain industries may have additional regulatory requirements or restrictions.


## Financial and capital considerations
Since a Representative Office does not generate income locally, its funding is entirely sourced from the parent company. Businesses should plan for:
  * Initial capitalization – The minimum inward remittance of US$ 30,000 proves financial capability.
  * Ongoing funding requirements – The parent company must remit at least US$ 30,000 annually to cover operational expenses.
  * Banking and remittance processes – Funds must be transferred through an authorized Philippine bank, with proper documentation for compliance.
  * Tax implications – While a Representative Office is exempt from corporate income tax, it is still subject to payroll taxes and other regulatory fees.


## Registration requirements and step-by-step process
To set up a Representative Office, follow these steps to obtain a License to Do Business from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):
  1. **Prepare the Required Documents:** Gather the necessary paperwork, including: 
     * SEC Application Form No. F-104 – Application of a Foreign Corporation to Establish a Representative Office in the Philippines.
     * Board Resolution – Notarized and apostilled certified copy authorizing the formation of the Representative Office and designating a Philippine resident or foreign national to receive summons and attend legal proceedings.
     * Financial Statements – Notarized and apostilled copy of the most recent audited financial statements of the parent company certified by a CPA.
     * Articles of Incorporation – Notarized and apostilled certified copies of the parent company’s Articles of Incorporation.
     * Bank Deposit Certificate – Certificate of Bank Deposit or Certificate of Inward Remittance of the US$ 30,000 to cover operational costs.
  2. **Reserve a Business Name** : Choose a unique name for the Representative Office and reserve it with the SEC.
  3. **Appoint a Local Representative** : Designate a resident agent or representative in the Philippines.
  4. **Submit Required Documents** : Provide all necessary paperwork, including the application form, board resolution, financial statements, articles of incorporation, and bank deposit certificate, to the SEC.
  5. **Obtain a License to Do Business:** Once approved, the SEC issues the license allowing the Representative Office to operate in the Philippines.


  1. **Register with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR)** – While exempt from corporate taxes, the office must obtain a **Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN)**.
  2. **Secure Local Business Permits** – Obtain necessary clearances from the local government unit where the office will be based.
  3. **Acquire Special Permits if Required** – Some industries may require additional sector-specific approvals.


## Appointing a resident agent
A Resident Agent acts as the official representative of a Representative Office in the Philippines, managing legal correspondence and regulatory interactions. Companies must carefully choose between appointing a foreign representative or a local agent, depending on legal and operational requirements.
The Resident Agent is responsible for handling legal documents, representing the Representative Office in administrative matters, and ensuring compliance with local regulations. If a foreign representative is selected, visa and work permit requirements must also be considered.
## Employment and staffing considerations
A Representative Office in the Philippines can hire local employees but must comply with the country’s labor laws. This includes enrolling employees in mandatory social security programs such as the Social Security System (SSS), PhilHealth, and the Home Development Mutual Fund (Pag-IBIG). Companies must also decide between directly hiring staff or outsourcing administrative functions. Additionally, if the Representative Office requires expatriate staff, proper visas and work permits must be obtained to ensure legal compliance.
## Compliance and ongoing obligations
Maintaining a Representative Office in the Philippines requires adherence to regulatory obligations, including:
  * Annual reporting to the **SEC**
  * Tax filings and payroll compliance with the **BIR**
  * Renewal of business permits with the local government
  * Submission of **audited financial statements** to relevant authorities
  * Compliance with **foreign investment reporting** regulations


Failure to comply with these obligations may result in penalties or revocation of business registration.

# Singapore’s Role as ASEAN’s Financial Hub: Can it Maintain its Lead?
March 31, 2025 Posted by ASEAN Briefing⟨136⟩ Written by  Reading Time: **4 minutes**
Singapore has long been recognized as the premier 
## Singapore’s financial strength today
Singapore’s financial sector remains a cornerstone of its economy, with significant contributions to GDP and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows. As of early 2025, the Singapore Exchange (SGX) boasts a market capitalization of over US$ 644 billion, surpassing many regional competitors, such as Bursa Malaysia (US$ 400 billion), the Indonesia Stock Exchange (US$600 billion), and the Stock Exchange of Thailand (US$500 billion). The country’s banking assets, led by institutions like DBS, OCBC, and UOB, collectively exceed US$ 1.64 trillion, positioning Singapore as a dominant player in ASEAN’s banking industry.
The city-state’s financial sector contributed approximately SGD 87.8 billion to the GDP in the previous year, demonstrating its integral role in Singapore’s economy. Additionally, Singapore’s FDI inflows remain among the highest globally, with US$ 159.6 billion in investments in 2023, reflecting continued confidence from international investors.
Singapore also serves as a key financial gateway for businesses entering ASEAN, facilitating cross-border transactions, banking services, and investment structuring. Its financial institutions play a pivotal role in regional trade financing and corporate expansion across Southeast Asia.
## The foundations of Singapore’s financial success
Singapore’s emergence as a financial hub is deeply rooted in strategic government policies and a historical legacy of trade and commerce. Following its independence, Singapore focused on developing an open economy with an emphasis on financial services. The government’s proactive regulatory framework, spearheaded by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), has consistently ensured financial stability and investor confidence⟨137⟩.
Political stability⟨138⟩ and the rule of law have further reinforced Singapore’s financial reputation. Transparent governance, coupled with a strong legal framework, has made the country an attractive destination for multinational financial institutions and asset managers. Additionally, Singapore’s proficiency in English and its international legal system have provided a seamless environment for global financial transactions.
## Competitive advantages that keep Singapore on top
Several factors contribute to Singapore’s enduring dominance in the financial sector:
  * **Regulatory strength:** Singapore is consistently ranked among the top financial jurisdictions globally. The country ranks fourth in the latest Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI), ahead of many competitors in Asia and just ahead of Hong Kong, which ranks fifth.
  * **Tax incentives⟨139⟩:** With a corporate tax rate of 17 percentage, Singapore remains more competitive than regional rivals such as Malaysia (24percentage) and Indonesia (22 percentage). Incentives such as the Financial Sector Incentive (FSI) scheme and wealth management tax exemptions further enhance its appeal.
  * **Talent pool and education:** Singapore’s financial sector employs approximately 190,000 professionals, with institutions like NUS, NTU, and INSEAD providing world-class finance training programs.
  * **Infrastructure and connectivity:** Changi Airport ranks among the busiest in the world, and Singapore boasts the fastest internet speeds globally, facilitating seamless financial transactions and connectivity.


## Challenges to Singapore’s financial dominance
While Singapore has long held its position as ASEAN’s premier financial hub, it now faces mounting challenges that could threaten its dominance. The rapid rise of competing financial centers in the region, particularly Bangkok, Jakarta, and Kuala Lumpur, is reshaping the competitive landscape, with each city aggressively expanding its banking and fintech sectors.

Meanwhile, China’s influence continues to grow, as financial hubs like Shanghai and Hong Kong attract increasing investment and market activity, diverting some of the financial flows that traditionally passed through Singapore.
Further, technological disruption, particularly in fintech and blockchain-based services, is redefining traditional banking models, necessitating swift adaptation. At the same time, talent retention poses a concern as financial professionals explore opportunities in emerging hubs that offer attractive incentives.
These factors combined create a more complex environment for Singapore, requiring proactive strategies to maintain its leadership position in ASEAN’s financial sector.
## Regional competitors gaining ground
Singapore’s leadership as ASEAN’s financial hub is increasingly being challenged by several emerging competitors across the region. Hong Kong, historically a key rival, continues to exert influence, though recent economic shifts have strengthened Singapore’s position in global financial competitiveness.
Malaysia has capitalized on its strength in Islamic finance⟨140⟩, with Kuala Lumpur emerging as a leader in this niche sector, boasting total Islamic banking assets surpassing US$ 290 billion in 2024, an area where Singapore lags. Thailand’s financial market is also expanding, with Bangkok experiencing steady growth in fintech and capital markets, attracting a rising number of new financial firms and startups. Indonesia and Vietnam, on the other hand, are seeing rapid development, with Indonesia’s financial sector continuing to grow and Vietnam’s startup ecosystem gaining traction among venture capital investors.
These developments indicate that while Singapore retains its dominant position, it must continuously innovate and adapt to maintain its lead amid intensifying regional competition.
## How Singapore is adapting to maintain its lead
To counter these challenges, Singapore is implementing several key strategies:
  * **FinTech and digital banking expansion:** Singapore continues to attract investment in fintech, maintaining its status as a leader in digital banking, blockchain, and payment solutions. MAS has also granted digital banking licenses to key financial players, enhancing financial inclusion for underserved businesses and individuals.
  * **Sustainability and green finance:** The MAS has launched initiatives to position Singapore as a global hub for sustainable finance, with an increasing number of green bonds issued.
  * **Wealth management focus:** Singapore remains a preferred destination for high-net-worth individuals, with tax-friendly policies and investment schemes tailored for asset management.
  * **ASEAN financial integration:** Singapore actively leads ASEAN’s financial integration efforts, ensuring its continued role as a regional financial gateway.


## The impact of ASEAN economic integration
As ASEAN moves toward greater financial integration, Singapore stands to benefit from increased cross-border banking and investment opportunities. However, deeper financial integration could also dilute Singapore’s centrality as a hub, with neighboring economies strengthening their financial sectors.
Singapore’s role in facilitating regional financial cooperation, particularly through frameworks like the ASEAN Banking Integration Framework (ABIF), will determine its continued influence in the regional financial landscape.
Yet, as financial transactions become more decentralized across ASEAN, Singapore must continue to differentiate itself through niche services such as wealth management and corporate banking.
## The future of Singapore’s financial sector
Looking ahead, Singapore’s ability to maintain its status as ASEAN’s financial hub will depend on several key factors:
  * Continued investment in financial technology and innovation to stay ahead of competitors.
  * Regulatory agility to respond to global financial shifts and economic uncertainties.
  * Attracting and retaining top financial talent through competitive policies and global recruitment.
  * Strengthening regional partnerships to reinforce Singapore’s position as the financial gateway to ASEAN.


By 2030, Singapore could either solidify its leadership as the financial epicenter of ASEAN or see a gradual decentralization of financial activity across the region. Its adaptability and proactive strategies will determine whether it maintains its dominance in the evolving financial landscape.

# How to Set Up a Representative Office in Thailand – A Guide for Foreign Investors
April 2, 2025 Posted by ASEAN Briefing⟨136⟩ Written by  Reading Time: **4 minutes**
representative office⟨137⟩ offers a non-commercial presence in Thailand, allowing foreign companies to explore the market, liaise with local partners, and conduct research without engaging in direct revenue-generating activities.
Understanding the role of representative offices, their legal framework, eligibility requirements, and compliance obligations is essential for foreign businesses considering this structure for market entry. Evaluating financial considerations and regulatory requirements will help determine whether a representative office aligns with long-term business goals.
## The role of a representative office in Thailand
A representative office is a legally recognized business entity in Thailand that allows foreign companies to conduct certain activities without engaging in direct sales or revenue-generating operations.
### Key functions and limitations
Representative offices can perform specific functions, including:
  * Conduct market research and feasibility studies for the parent company.
  * Providing advisory services on the company’s products or services to local distributors.
  * Sourcing goods and services for the parent company.
  * Inspecting and controlling the quality of goods purchased by the parent company.
  * Disseminating information about new products.


However, representative offices are strictly prohibited from generating income, signing contracts on behalf of the parent company, or engaging in any form of direct trade or business transactions.
## Benefits for foreign businesses
Setting up a representative office provides several advantages for foreign businesses. It offers low operational costs since it does not engage in commercial activities, keeping financial and regulatory obligations minimal. It also serves as a facilitated market entry strategy, allowing businesses to assess the Thai market before making larger investments.
Find Business Support
A representative office provides legal flexibility, requiring less bureaucratic involvement than a fully operational subsidiary. Additionally, it enjoys tax benefits as it does not generate income and is generally exempt from corporate income tax in Thailand.
## Legal and financial requirements
Before applying, foreign companies must meet specific legal and financial requirements set by Thailand’s regulatory authorities.
**Capital Requirements**
  * The company must remit at least 3 million baht (US$ 87,821) as the minimum capital required to start operations.
  * The capital must be transferred in stages: 25 percent within the first three months, 50 percent within the first year, and the full amount within three years.


**Foreign Business License (FBL)**
  * As a service business under the Foreign Business Act (FBA), the representative office must apply for an FBL from the Department of Business Development (DBD).


**Local employment**
  * While there are no explicit requirements to hire a specific number of Thai employees, having local staff for research or liaising purposes is beneficial.


## Preparing for the application process
Thorough preparation is essential for a smooth application process. Companies must gather necessary documentation and appoint key personnel before submitting their application.
### Required documents
The parent company must provide:
  * Corporate registration documents from its home country.
  * Financial statements verifying financial stability.
  * Board resolutions authorizing the establishment of the representative office.
  * Power of attorney grants legal authority to the office’s appointed manager.


All documents must be **translated into Thai and notarized** before submission.
## Step-by-step application process
Establishing a representative office involves multiple steps, primarily overseen by Thailand’s Ministry of Commerce (MOC).
  1. **Understand the role of a representative office** – Ensure that the intended activities align with the permitted functions and limitations of a representative office in Thailand.
  2. **Meet capital and legal requirements** – Verify that the parent company meets the financial prerequisites and is eligible for a Foreign Business License.
  3. **Prepare required documentation** – Gather all necessary documents, including corporate registration papers, financial statements, board resolutions, and notarized translations.
  4. **Submit Foreign Business License (FBL) Application** – File an application with the Department of Business Development (DBD) under the Ministry of Commerce.
  5. **Provide supporting documents** – Ensure all required forms and supporting documents are correctly certified and submitted.
  6. **Pay application fees** – Settle applicable processing fees to initiate the review process.
  7. **Undergo review and verification** – The authorities will assess the application and may request additional information or clarification.
  8. **Receive approval and register** – Once approved, proceed with the formal registration of the representative office.


The approval process generally takes a few months, depending on the completeness of the submission and any additional regulatory reviews required.
## Staffing and work permit regulations
A representative office in Thailand is not permitted to hire an extensive local workforce, but it must still comply with specific staffing and work permit regulations.
The appointed representative office manager must receive approval from the Ministry of Commerce, and the office must adhere to Thailand’s foreign-to-local staff ratio requirements.
Foreign employees working for the representative office require valid work permits, which must be renewed annually. Moreover, the office must comply with Thailand’s social security and labor laws governing employment.
## Compliance and ongoing obligations
Once operational, a representative office in Thailand must comply with various legal and financial requirements to maintain its status. This includes submitting annual reports to the Ministry of Commerce, ensuring timely tax filings even though the office is exempt from corporate income tax, and handling payroll tax obligations for employees.
Further, foreign staff must renew their visas and work permits as required by Thai law. The office must also keep accurate financial records to demonstrate adherence to non-commercial activity regulations.
Failure to meet these compliance obligations may result in penalties or the revocation of the representative office’s license.
## Comparing representative offices with alternative entry strategies
A representative office is just one of several entry options for foreign businesses in Thailand. Comparing it with alternative structures can help companies determine the best approach.
### Representative office vs. branch office
  * A branch office can conduct revenue-generating activities, while a representative office cannot.
  * Branch offices require higher capital investment and have more outstanding compliance obligations.


### Representative office vs. Thai limited company
  * A limited company (foreign-owned or joint venture) can operate commercially but requires local licensing and regulatory compliance.
  * Setting up a limited company may be ideal for businesses seeking direct market participation.


### When to upgrade from a representative office
  * If a foreign business intends to start commercial operations, it may need to transition to a branch office or a limited company.
  * Representative offices are ideal for early-stage market research, but businesses should consider upgrading when engaging in trade activities.

# Qualifying as a Reputable Exporter and Importer in Indonesia
January 5, 2022 Posted by Ayman Falak⟨136⟩ Written by  Reading Time: **3 minutes**
Indonesia’s Ministry of Trade (MoT) issued MoT Reg 17/2021 in April 2021, which sets out the criteria for qualifying as a reputable exporter and importer in Indonesia and the benefits it entails.
Among the benefits is the instant approval of business licenses, such as export approvals and import approvals as well as the removal of surveyor report requirements for mandatory commodities.
MoT Reg 17/2021 is an implementing regulation to Government Regulation 29 of 2021⟨137⟩ (GR 29/2021), which was enacted in early 2021 to simplify regulations in Indonesia’s trade sector. GR 29/2021 is also an implementing regulation of the Omnibus Law⟨138⟩.
## What is a reputable exporter or importer?
MoT Reg 17/2021 describes a reputable exporter and importer as businesses that have shown a high level of compliance to implement the laws and regulations set by the government in regard to imports and exports. According to 
Find Business Support
Despite the advantage of a reputable exporter or importer being instantly approved for business licenses, they are **not exempt** from being inspected by the authorities.
### Obtaining export and import approvals
The types of business licenses reputable exporters and importers are eligible to receive are called the export approval license and the import approval license. 
For reputable exporters that hold an export approval license, they are automatically approved to export some nine types of goods and commodities. Some are listed below.

For reputable importers that hold an import approval license, they are automatically approved to import 77 types of goods and commodities. Some are also listed below.

## How can you be classified as a reputable exporter and importer?
To be recognized as a reputable exporter and importer, MoT Reg 17/2021 sets out the following criteria:
### For exporters
  * Fulfill the obligation to report on the realization of all exports that have been undertaken for every commodity;
  * Must be a valid taxpayer for the last two years, which will be confirmed by the Ministry of Finance;
  * Have carried out the export of goods in the last two years in accordance with the line of business;
  * The business has never been the subject of administrative sanctions due to violating the regulations for exporters;
  * The business has never been subject to criminal sanctions; and
  * The business is currently not under administrative sanctions.


### For importers
  * Fulfill the obligation to report on the realization of all imports that have been undertaken for every commodity;
  * Must be a valid taxpayer for the last two years, which will be confirmed by the Ministry of Finance;
  * Have carried out the import of goods in the last two years in accordance with the line of business;
  * The business has never been the subject of administrative sanctions due to violating the regulations for exporters;
  * The business has never been subject to criminal sanctions; and
  * The business is currently not under administrative sanctions.


Another way to be determined as a reputable exporter and importer is if the business has been awarded the status of an Authorized Economic Operator or as a Main Customs Partners.
Find Business Support
The Director-General of Foreign Trade on behalf of the Minister of Trade will determine who is granted the reputable exporter and importer status.
## Suspension and revocation of the reputable exporter and importer status
Businesses can have their reputable exporter and importer status suspended if they fail to uphold any of the criteria mentioned or they are under investigation for criminal acts in the trade sector.
The status as a reputable exporter and importer can be revoked if the business does not meet the suspension conditions after a period of no later than 30 days, after the date of suspension. Further, the status can also be revoked if they are found guilty of a crime in the trade sector, abuse of the business license, and/or have received three suspension sanctions within three years.

April 3, 2025 Posted by ASEAN Briefing⟨136⟩ Reading Time: **3 minutes**
The latest issue of ASEAN Briefing Magazine, titled “
## What’s in this Issue?
  * **Chapter 1:** Establishing a Business in Malaysia: Legal Structures and Compliance
  * **Chapter 2:** Navigating Malaysia’s Tax System
  * **Chapter 3:** Unlocking High-Growth Investment Sectors in Malaysia


Malaysia is emerging as one of Southeast Asia’s most attractive investment destinations, offering a diverse economy, pro-business policies, and a strategic position within the ASEAN region. As global businesses seek expansion opportunities in Asia, Malaysia’s well-developed manufacturing base, financial services sector, healthcare industry, and digital economy provide compelling avenues for foreign investors.
Find Business Support
Each sector presents unique advantages for investors looking to capitalize on Malaysia’s growing economy. The manufacturing sector, a key driver of the country’s exports, is expanding into high-value industries such as electronics, automotive, and aerospace, supported by advanced infrastructure and investment incentives.⟨137⟩ In financial services, Malaysia is a recognized leader in Islamic finance, with a mature banking system and a globally influential sukuk market. The healthcare industry⟨138⟩, particularly in medical tourism, is rapidly growing, attracting international patients and fostering private-sector investments in specialized healthcare facilities and digital health solutions. Meanwhile, the technology and digital economy sector, led by data center⟨139⟩ expansion, cloud computing⟨139⟩, and AI-driven innovations, is transforming Malaysia into a regional hub for digital infrastructure.
This issue of Investing in Malaysia provides a comprehensive analysis of the country’s key investment sectors, outlining growth trends, regulatory developments, and investment incentives. Designed for foreign investors, this guide explores how businesses can successfully enter Malaysia’s dynamic market while leveraging its competitive advantages. 
##  **Chapter** summaries
**Chapter 1:** Malaysia offers various business structures for foreign investors, with private limited companies being the most common. Selecting the right entity impacts ownership rights, tax obligations, and operational flexibility, making it a crucial step for market entry.
**Chapter 2:** Malaysia’s territorial tax system ensures that only income sourced within the country is subject to taxation. Corporate income tax, sales and service tax, withholding tax, and digital service tax apply to businesses, with rates depending on entity type and revenue.
**Chapter 3:** Malaysia continues to attract foreign investment across key sectors, including high-tech manufacturing, Islamic finance, healthcare innovation, and digital infrastructure.

# Malaysia’s Global Minimum Tax: Key Implications for Multinationals
April 3, 2025 Posted by ASEAN Briefing⟨136⟩ Written by  Reading Time: **3 minutes**
Malaysia has implemented the Global Minimum Tax (GMT) as part of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS).
Under Malaysia’s GMT framework, two key tax mechanisms have been introduced to ensure compliance with the 15 percent minimum effective tax rate. The Domestic Top-up Tax (DTT) applies to Malaysian entities, ensuring they meet the required tax threshold, while the Multinational Top-up Tax (MTT) is designed for MNEs operating in Malaysia to align their global income taxation with international standards.
Companies falling below this threshold must file a top-up tax return, with transitional penalty relief available to support businesses during the initial implementation phase.
This framework, effective from January 1, 2025, is part of Malaysia’s commitment to aligning its tax policies with OECD guidelines and maintaining competitiveness within the ASEAN region.
## Background on the OECD Global Minimum Tax Initiative
The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework aims to address challenges in taxing digital and global businesses, introducing two pillars. Pillar One reallocates taxing rights to market jurisdictions, while Pillar Two establishes the 15 percent global minimum tax. Malaysia has actively participated in these discussions, aligning its tax policies with international standards.
Find Business Support
Countries worldwide are implementing the Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) Rules to prevent tax base erosion. Malaysia joins economies like Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, and Korea, all of which have adopted GMT since 2024.
## Scope of application in Malaysia
The GMT applies to large MNEs meeting the revenue threshold of EUR 750 million. This affects sectors benefiting from existing tax incentives, including manufacturing, finance, and technology.
Malaysia’s GMT implementation considers:
  * **Tax incentives:** Pioneer status and Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) benefits may require restructuring to align with GMT requirements.
  * **Special economic zones:** Entities operating in Free Industrial Zones (FIZs) and Labuan International Business and Financial Centre (IBFC) must assess their exposure to the new rules.


### Technical implementation details
Malaysia’s approach to GMT compliance involves calculating the effective tax rate for entities to determine any necessary top-up tax, applying substance-based income exclusion rules for qualifying economic activities, and adhering to new filing obligations requiring comprehensive documentation of tax structures, revenue streams, and effective tax positions.
## Implementation timelines across ASEAN
ASEAN countries have implemented GMT at different paces, with Malaysia’s 2025 rollout aligning closely with key regional players. Singapore has implemented the IIR and DTT as of January 2025, focusing on a smooth transition with comprehensive data reporting.
Indonesia launched its core tax system in January 2025, leveraging digital administration to streamline compliance. Thailand introduced new tax regulations targeting income transfers and social security adjustments, reflecting a broader regulatory shift.
Vietnam, after initiating public consultation on its Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (QDMTT) in late 2024, has confirmed its implementation for 2025, emphasizing domestic tax base protection.
These varied approaches highlight the region’s differing national priorities and regulatory frameworks.
## Differences in compliance requirements
Malaysia’s tax framework is structured to ensure compliance with OECD guidelines while maintaining investment appeal. Key differences across ASEAN include:
  * **Malaysia:** Stringent compliance and reporting obligations under enhanced transfer pricing and tax audit frameworks.
  * **Singapore:** Focuses on smooth implementation with comprehensive data reporting requirements.
  * **Indonesia:** Leverages electronic platforms to streamline compliance.
  * **Thailand:** Introduces targeted regulations on income transfers.
  * **Vietnam:** Develops guidelines emphasizing domestic tax base protection.


## Impact on Malaysia’s existing tax incentives
Malaysia’s tax incentive landscape has undergone significant adjustments under GMT. Pioneer status, MSC incentives, and tax holidays are being modified to comply with the new tax framework. The government is expected to recalibrate policies to maintain Malaysia’s investment attractiveness.
## Implications for companies in Malaysia
Multinational companies must reassess their tax planning strategies and business structures. The financial impact of the new tax rules varies depending on existing incentives, sectoral exposure, and compliance costs. Key considerations include:
  * Cash flow adjustments: Companies may need to restructure financial models to account for additional tax liabilities.
  * Investment decisions: MNEs evaluating Malaysia must factor in GMT compliance costs against existing tax incentives.
  * Restructuring needs: Entities may have to adjust operational models to optimize tax efficiency under the new rules.


### Compliance requirements
Companies must meet new documentation and reporting obligations, including:
  * Submission of top-up tax returns for entities with an effective tax rate below 15 percent.
  * Enhanced transfer pricing documentation and tax audit frameworks.
  * Penalties for non-compliance under Malaysia’s Inland Revenue Board (IRBM) enforcement policies.


## Regional comparison
Malaysia’s GMT adoption follows a broader regional trend but takes a distinct approach compared to its neighbors. Singapore has maintained its foreign direct investment competitiveness with a business-friendly GMT framework, while Indonesia has emphasized digital tax administration to simplify compliance. Thailand has introduced tax regulations focused on labor and social security, whereas Vietnam has prioritized domestic tax base protection in its policies.
Each ASEAN country has adapted its GMT framework to align with its economic priorities, creating diverse regional compliance landscapes.
While Malaysia remains committed to aligning with OECD standards, uncertainties in enforcement mechanisms and future amendments to compliance regulations could impact long-term tax planning strategies.

# What are Indonesia’s Latest Guidelines on International Travel?
April 7, 2022 Posted by ASEAN Briefing⟨136⟩ Written by  Reading Time: **3 minutes**
**_This article was originally published on January 4, 2021, and has been updated on May 19, 2022, as per the latest developments._**
Indonesia has allowed all foreign travelers with valid visas to enter the country. 
If the traveler has only received only **one dose** of vaccination, then they must quarantine for **5 x 24hrs**. However, if the traveler has been double or triple vaccinated, **there is no quarantine required**. 
## Visa on arrival
Foreign tourists from 43 countries can now enter Indonesia through a visa on arrival. The updated list of countries can be found 
## **What are the pre-departure requirements to enter Indonesia?**
There will be stricter health protocols for both Indonesian and foreign travelers entering the country. They will need to comply with the following requirements before traveling:
  * Foreign nationals must be **fully vaccinated** before entering Indonesia and must show their vaccination certificate to immigration officials upon arrival;
  * Indonesia citizens are still permitted to enter the country without being fully vaccinated but will be vaccinated **upon arrival** — this is compulsory;
  * In addition to a valid visa, fully vaccinated travelers are **no longer required** to take a pre-departure PCR test;
  * Foreigner travelers must have health insurance (coverage of at least US$25,000) and can cover the needs for COVID-19 treatment; and 
  * They must also fill out the electronic Health Alert Card (e-HAC) through the 


Foreigners already in Indonesia who wish to travel domestically are required to be vaccinated (first dose) through the Indonesian government-initiated vaccination program. 
## **What happens upon arrival in Indonesia?**
### Checkpoint 1
Upon arrival, travelers will be sorted into their categories as well as data collection by airport officials.
### Checkpoint 2
All passengers will head towards the health document verification area, which includes being checked for their vaccination certificates, and e-HAC forms. 
### Checkpoint 3
All passengers will be taken to do a health check by health officials to see if they have symptoms of COVID-19.
### Checkpoint 4
Passengers will then go through immigration and customs.
### Checkpoint 5
After immigration, passengers will wait at a holding area under the supervision of personnel from the airforce. 
### Checkpoint 6
Passengers will be allowed to continue on their journey.
### Quarantine for foreign travelers
If the foreign traveler has only received **one dose** of vaccination, they must quarantine for **5 x 24hrs** , and undertake a second PCR test on the **4th day** of quarantine.
The quarantine hotel and PCR tests will be at the expense of the foreign traveler. If the result is positive, the traveler will be referred to a COVID-19 hospital – where costs will be borne by the foreign traveler.
If the foreign traveler is **double** vaccinated or has received a **booster** jab, then they **do not require quarantine**. 
### Indonesian travelers
Indonesian citizens who have not been vaccinated can still enter the country but will be **vaccinated during quarantine**.
They will stay in quarantine for **5 x 24hrs** if they only received **one dose** of vaccination, and will also undertake a second PCR test on the **4th day** of quarantine.
The quarantine facilities and PCR tests are free of charge.
If the Indonesian traveler is **double** vaccinated or has received a **booster** jab, then they do not require quarantine. However, they must stay in their place of accommodation and wait for the results of their COVID-19 test (usually within 24hrs). If the Indonesian traveler is found to be positive, they will be sent to a COVID-19 referral hospital, free of charge.

# Laos’ Labor Market Challenges and Opportunities: What Investors Should Consider
April 1, 2025 Posted by ASEAN Briefing⟨136⟩ Written by  Reading Time: **3 minutes**
Laos has emerged as an attractive investment destination in Southeast Asia, driven by its strategic location, natural resources, and improving business environment. As part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and a key player in regional trade agreements, Laos has seen steady economic growth, particularly in infrastructure, energy, and manufacturing. However, its labor market remains a critical factor for investors assessing opportunities in the country.
Find Business Support
The economy is heavily reliant on agriculture, hydropower, and mining, but new industries, such as manufacturing and tourism, are gaining momentum. Foreign investment, particularly from China, Thailand, and Vietnam, plays a significant role in economic development. Understanding Laos’s labor market is essential for businesses looking to operate efficiently and overcome workforce-related challenges.
## Workforce composition and employment landscape
Laos’ workforce is characterized by a young population, with a high proportion of workers engaged in agriculture. The shift toward urbanization has led to changes in labor availability, particularly in manufacturing and services.
  * Total labor force size: The total labor force in Laos is approximately 3.17 million people as of 2023.
  * Unemployment rate and underemployment: The unemployment rate in Laos for 2023 is 1.18 percent, indicating a relatively stable job market. However, specific data on underemployment is not readily available.
  * Labor force participation rate: The overall participation rate is 59.62 percent, with males at 63.24 percent and females at 55.97 percent.
  * Urban and rural labor distribution: While cities like Vientiane attract workers to emerging industries, much of the labor force remains rural, limiting access to skilled workers for businesses in urban centers.
  * **Education and skills development:**
    * Literacy rate: The adult literacy rate in Laos is 84.7 percent, while the youth literacy rate is 92.5 percent.
    * Tertiary education enrollment**:** The gross enrollment ratio for tertiary education in Laos is **12 percent** as of 2021.
    * Educational attainment: 
      * Primary or Less: 50%
      * Lower Secondary: 18%
      * Upper Secondary: 22%
      * University and Higher: 4%
    * Industries with the highest demand for skilled labor: 
      * Manufacturing: Due to ongoing industrialization efforts.
      * Infrastructure Development: Significant investments in infrastructure projects.
      * Tourism: The Growing tourism sector requires skilled hospitality workers.
      * Agriculture: Modernization of agricultural practices.
      * Technology: Increasing demand for tech-savvy professionals.


**Wage Trends and Regional Comparison**
**Country** |  **Minimum Wage**  
---|---  
**Laos** |  1,600,000 kip per month (US$ 85)  
**Thailand** |  THB 313–336 per day (US$ 9–10), varies by province  
**Vietnam** |  VND 3,250,000–4,680,000 per month (US$ 141–203), varies by location  
**Cambodia** |  US$ 208 per month (garment and footwear workers)  
**Myanmar** |  4,800 kyat per day (US$ 2.30)  
## Key challenges affecting the labor market
Investors in Laos face multiple labor-related challenges that influence business operations and workforce efficiency, including a shortage of skilled workers, a high rate of informal employment, and significant labor migration to neighboring countries. With only four percent of the workforce holding a university degree and 12 percent of eligible students enrolled in tertiary education, the country struggles to meet the demand for skilled labor.
Additionally, 82.5 percent of employment remains informal, limiting job security and structured workforce development. The migration of Laotian workers is due to low wages, limited career growth, and suboptimal working conditions. Language barriers and complex labor regulations add to these difficulties, making it crucial for foreign investors to navigate legal frameworks effectively.
The lack of vocational training institutions has left many industries struggling to find specialized talent, while rural areas continue to have limited formal employment opportunities.
### Opportunities for foreign investors
Despite the challenges, Laos presents significant opportunities for foreign investors seeking cost-effective labor and emerging market potential.
The country’s relatively low labor costs make it an attractive destination for labor-intensive industries such as manufacturing and textiles, while ongoing infrastructure development projects create demand for foreign expertise and investment.
The tourism sector continues to expand, offering opportunities for businesses in hospitality, travel, and service industries. Further, the Laotian government is making strides in vocational training and skills development, which could help bridge the talent gap over time. Foreign businesses that invest in local workforce training programs can secure a dedicated and skilled workforce while also benefiting from potential government incentives for foreign investment.
