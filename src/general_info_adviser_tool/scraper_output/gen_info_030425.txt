            "An amendment to China’s Criminal Law seeks to toughen anti-bribery provisions by increasing penalties and expanding the scope of implementation to include private companies. In addition to improving rules on anti-corruption in China, the amendment is seen as part of the government’s wider effort to boost the private sector by addressing issues commonly faced by private companies. We discuss the possible impact of the amendment on private companies."

            "Key amendments to the Criminal Law",
            "Private enterprises added to anti-bribery articles",
            "Many of the amendments to the Criminal Law involve adding clauses clarifying that the anti-bribery provisions for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) also apply to private companies. Previously, the law did not explicitly state whether these clauses applied to private companies or not. For instance, Article 165 of the Criminal Law prohibits and penalizes senior-level employees of SOEs for taking advantage of their positions to operate businesses similar to that of the company they work for and profit therefrom. The individual involved may be liable to a fine, and, if the profits obtained are particularly large, may be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of between three and seven years. A clause has been added to this article stating that this article also applies to senior-level employees of private enterprises who engage in this type of behavior if it causes “significant losses to the interests of the company or enterprise”. The individuals involved are liable for the same penalties as those working in SOEs. Similar clauses expanding the scope to include private companies and their employees have been added to the following articles: Article 166, which prohibits employees from engaging in nepotism related to the handing over a profit-making business, purchasing or selling of goods and services at above or below market prices, respectively, or purchasing and accepting substandard goods and services; and Article 169, prohibits and penalizes persons in charge of a company from engaging in malpractice or favoritism for personal gain and converting company assets into shares or selling them at a low price."

In the previous version of the Criminal Law, units found guilty of this crime will be fined, while persons found to be directly responsible will be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of up to five years or criminal detention (detention of between one and six months). Following the amendment, the article now reads: In serious circumstances, the unit shall be fined, and the directly responsible person in charge and other directly responsible personnel shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of up to three years or criminal detention (detention of between one and six months); and In particularly serious circumstances, the individual shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of between three and 10 years."

            "Addition of fines for bribery and provision of property for illegal benefits",
            "Three articles have been amended to add fines for acts of bribery. Some of the sentence terms have also been adjusted, and penalties for particularly serious violations have been added in some cases. They are as follows: Article 390, which penalizes the act of bribery, has been amended to impose fines on persons who commit bribery. It also adds specific circumstances in which severe punishment can be meted out. The addition of fines has been made in the following instances: For persons who commit the crime of bribery, the fixed term sentenced has been reduced from up to five years to up to three years; however, they are now also liable for a fine; For persons who seek improper benefits through bribery, and the circumstances are serious and result in heavy losses to national interests, they will be liable for a fine in addition to a fixed-term prison sentence of between three and 10 years (prison term remains unchanged). For persons who seek improper benefits through bribery, if the circumstances are particularly serious, or result in particularly heavy losses to national interests, the offender shall be liable to a fine, in addition to a fixed-term prison sentence of between 10 years and life, and have their property confiscated (prison term and confiscation of property remains unchanged). Article 391, which stipulates penalties for persons who give property to state agencies, SOEs, enterprises, institutions, or people’s organizations to seek illegitimate benefits, or who violate state regulations and provide kickbacks or handling fees (under various guises) during economic transactions. Persons found guilty will be fined and given a prison sentence of up to three years. In serious circumstances, a new addition will be fined and given a fixed-term prison sentence of between three and five years. Article 393, which deals with companies that pay bribes to obtain illegal benefits or violate state regulations by giving kickbacks or handling fees to state workers, states that in serious circumstances, the entity shall be fined. Meanwhile, the persons directly responsible shall be sentenced to a fixed-term prison term of up to three years (previously five) or criminal detention and be fined. If the circumstances are particularly serious (a new addition), they shall be sentenced to prison for between three and 10 years and receive a fine."

            "Addition of severe punishment for bribery and reduced penalty for early confessions",
            "Meanwhile, Article 390 has a new clause stipulating the circumstances in which someone can be subject to a “heavier punishment” (从重处罚): Giving bribes multiple times or paying bribes to multiple people; Bribery committed by state functionaries; Paying bribes in national key projects or major projects; Paying bribes to obtain positions, promotions, or adjustments; Paying bribes to supervision, administrative law enforcement, and judicial staff; Bribery and illegal and criminal activities in the fields of ecology and the environment, finance, production safety, food and medicine, disaster prevention and relief, social security, education, medical care, etc.; and The use of illegal gains to pay bribes. Article 62 of the Criminal Law stipulates that “If a criminal offender falls under circumstances for a heavy or light punishment as stipulated in this law, the punishment shall be imposed within the limits of the statutory penalty.” Under this definition, it is understood that a “heavier punishment” means, for instance, a prison sentence that is closer to or at the upper limit of the permitted term of imprisonment for a given crime. Finally, the article has also been amended to allow for reduced punishment for people who take the initiative to confess to committing bribery before being prosecuted. Specifically, in the case where the crime is relatively minor and plays a key role in making a breakthrough in the investigation or solving a major case and have conducted themselves in a way deemed worthy of merit, then they may have their punishment reduced or be exempted from punishment."

            "Impact of the amendments on private companies in China",
            "The scope of amendments to the Criminal Law is relatively limited, and therefore in practice will not make a big change to how private companies can deal with bribery within their own ranks. However, it does signal that the government is taking seriously issues faced by private companies and taking another step toward providing equal treatment for private and state-owned companies. As noted by policy research firm Trivium China, the amendment’s “importance is symbolic. It shows that the legislature is doing its part to fulfill Beijing’s private sector support campaign.” The Chinese government has been striving to boost the country’s private sector and encourage more foreign investment since the country’s reopening after the COVID-19 pandemic. Efforts have thus far mostly involved improving the business environment to remove obstacles for private companies. These include the National Development and Reform Commission’s (NDRC) measures to boost private investment, and the State Council’s guidelines to boost foreign investment. The amendments to the Criminal Law signal that the government is also looking to support the private sector by improving their legal rights and protections and could mean further improvements to related legislation is to come."

            "Formulating a plan: Once objectives are set, the next phase is to outline strategies and actions. This involves detailed planning, such as identifying assets for divestiture and potential buyers in a divestiture restructuring. Collaboration with compliance departments is crucial to ensure legal adherence.",

            "Managing transitional challenges: During implementation, changes in operations, procedures, departments, or ownership take place. This often requires hiring financial and legal advisors. Parts of the company might be sold, new leadership, such as a CEO, may be appointed, and changes in computer systems, networks, and locations could occur. Unfortunately, this phase can also lead to job redundancies and layoffs."

The primary aim of restructuring is to realign a company's operations and finances with its strategic objectives, which may involve various approaches like management realignment and operational framework reorganization. Layoffs might occur if there is an overlap in roles or a closure of non-performing units, but they are one of many possible changes that can happen during restructuring.",
            "How many times can a company restructure?",
            "There's no limit on how often a company can undergo restructuring. The frequency and necessity of restructuring depend on various factors, including shifts in market dynamics, financial pressures, regulatory changes, and the need for operational efficiency. Companies may restructure multiple times as they adapt to continually evolving business environments and strategic goals.",
            "What is the primary goal of company restructuring?",
            "The primary goal of company restructuring is to enhance its operational resilience and align its operations and finances with strategic goals and market demands. This process, driven by a need for greater efficiency and adaptability, involves reorganizing management structures, financial frameworks, and operational procedures to improve business performance and competitiveness.",
            "What are the risks involved in corporate restructuring?",
            "Corporate restructuring carries several risks, including the financial burden of restructuring costs (such as reducing product lines or relocating employees), potential disruption to regular business operations, and the impact on employee morale and productivity due to changes in the organizational structure. Additionally, there's the risk that the restructuring might not achieve its intended objectives, which could further strain the company's resources.",
            "Can restructuring lead to a change in company leadership?",
            "Yes, restructuring can lead to changes in company leadership. Part of the restructuring process may involve hiring new executives, such as a Chief Executive Officer (CEO), to guide the company through the transition and implement new strategies. Leadership changes are crucial to driving the restructuring process and ensuring its success."

This approach minimizes the storage and holding costs associated with excess inventory. Implementing JIT in China can be challenging due to factors such as minimum order quantities (MOQs), fluctuating supplier quality, and delivery uncertainties. Despite these hurdles, several industries, including automotive OEMs, have successfully adopted JIT practices by fostering closer collaborations with suppliers. These businesses negotiate flexible delivery schedules and smaller, more frequent orders, even if it means paying a slightly higher price per unit. Success in JIT implementation often involves selecting the right suppliers willing to adapt their processes for more frequent, precise deliveries, enhancing overall supply chain efficiency."

This prioritization helps businesses focus their resources and management efforts where they are most needed. By implementing ABC analysis, companies can tailor their inventory management strategies to each category's specific needs.

            "What accounting standards are adopted in China? China has its own accounting rules referred to as the Chinese Accounting Standards (CAS). Despite substantial convergence between CAS and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that most Western investors are used to, practical implementation and interpretation differences remain. The CAS framework is based on two standards: Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises (ASBEs); and Accounting Standards for Small Business Enterprises (ASSBEs). The ASBE standards are significantly converged with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and all listed companies in China must comply with the ASBEs for the preparation of their financial statements. Most foreign-invested entities also generally follow the ASBEs. The ASSBEs are a counterpart of the ASBEs, providing unified standards for small-size enterprises. The ASSBEs use the ASBEs as a reference but are more similar to tax laws in terms of their tax calculation methods, which simplify the process of making adjustments between accounting standards and tax rules. Small-scale enterprises can choose to adopt either the ASBEs or ASSBEs."

            "In addition to the CAS framework introduced above, some enterprises adopt the Accounting System for Business Enterprises. The Accounting System for Business Enterprises constitutes 14 chapters that outline the basic principles, methods, and rules for accounting and financial reporting in China. It applies to all types of medium and large companies except for listed companies and financial and insurance companies. Compared to CAS, the Accounting System for Business Enterprises is targeted at enterprises in specific industries, while CAS is targeted at specific economic businesses (transaction or event) or a specific reporting item. With a growing number of companies voluntarily adopting the CAS framework, the Accounting System for Business Enterprises is becoming less common, even if it is China-specific and easy to implement. Further, starting January 1, 2021, several accounting standards regarding revenue, leases, and financial instruments, have applied to all entities that adopt the CAS. These new standards include: Chinese Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises No.14 – Revenue (2017) (CAS14); Chinese Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises No.21 – Leases (2018) (CAS21); Chinese Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises No.22 – Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments (2017) (CAS22); Chinese Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises No.23 – Transfer of Financial Assets (2017) (CAS23); Chinese Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises No.24 – Hedge Accounting (2017) (CAS24); and Chinese Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises No.37 – Presentation of Financial Instruments (2017) (CAS37). After January 1, 2022, the following accounting standards and interpretations are in force: Chinese Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises Interpretation No.15 (2021); Chinese Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises Interpretation No.16 (2022); and Chinese Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises No.25 – Insurance Contract (2020) (CAS25) (effective date: 1 January 2023)."

            "Difference in liabilities For liabilities, there is no provision on tax laws because liability is not directly deductible before tax. However, liabilities are often closely linked to costs and expenses. Often, the book-tax differences in liabilities are actually the book-tax differences due to costs and expenses. In practice, the costs and expenses corresponding to the actual liabilities can be deducted before tax if the documents in accordance with the provisions of tax laws are obtained. For example, where an enterprise leases an office space but fails to pay the rent due to financial difficulty, the liability corresponding to the rent can still be deducted if the enterprise has obtained the invoice from the landlord. Alternatively, where the enterprise hasn’t received the qualified invoice from the landlord, this part of the liability cannot be deducted before tax, even if the enterprise recognizes the liability in accounting. Besides, according to tax laws, contingent liabilities or accrued expenses are liabilities that an enterprise has not actually incurred and thus shall not be tax-deductible until they are settled. They are temporary differences. The amount payable to government authorities, such as fines and penalties, is however not tax-deductible, thus, it shall be treated as a permanent difference."

            "Differences in costs and expenses Under CAS, expenses can be recognized when the outflow of economic benefits in the course of ordinary activities is likely to result in a decrease in enterprise assets or an increase in liabilities, and the outflow of economic benefits can be measured reliably. There are very few restrictions on the recognition of expenses, except when expenditure provides future economic benefits and can be capitalized and amortized in future periods, which can be recognized by satisfying the “likely” condition. Such expenses shall be accounted for on an accrual basis rather than on a cash basis, and there are no deduction limits. However, under tax laws, such as the CIT Law and the CIT Implementation Regulation, there are several requirements for expenses to be pre-tax deductible. For example, for employee welfare expenses, only the part actually paid, and less than 14 percent of the total amount of employee salaries and wages can be deducted before tax. On the other hand, there are some tax incentives that allow enterprises to get a super deduction on their expenses incurred for certain activities. For example, for manufacturing enterprises (except tobacco manufacturing), an additional 100 percent of R&D expenses could be deducted from the taxable income; thus, the tax basis can be 200 percent of the actual costs for CIT purposes."

            "Differences in the presentation of financial statements CAS and IFRS have multiple differences regarding the presentation of the financial statements. As a communication exercise, financial statements are intended to provide investors and other stakeholders with high-quality, decision-useful financial information. The difference on this level is thus of special importance. For example, CAS and IFRS are different in: Accounting year: CAS mandates that the accounting year must start on January 1 and end on December 31 of each year. While under IFRS, the accounting year is not specified and an entity can consistently prepare financial statements for a one-year period, such as the February 1 to January 31 of each year. The IFRS even allows the accounting year not to follow the full calendar year. For example, some entities prefer to report for a 52-week period for practical reasons, which is allowed by IFRS. Presentation currency: Chinese accounting laws require that a set of financial statements for statutory purposes must be presented in RMB. Foreign transactions must be converted to RMB in accordance with relevant accounting standards. There is no such requirement in IFRS in terms of presentation currency. Title of the financial statements: CAS and IFRS have different titles for the financial statements. For example, the “balance sheet” under CAS is called a “statement of financial position” under IFRS, and the “income statement” under CAS is called a “statement of profit or loss” under IFRS. Income statement by nature or by function: Expenses in an income statement are either classified by their nature or by their function. IFRS allows expenses to be presented by functions or by nature, while CAS only permits expenses to be presented by functions. On this aspect, IFRS allows greater flexibility. Classification of accounts: A chart of accounts (COA) is an index of all the financial accounts in the general ledger of a company. It offers a digestible breakdown of all the financial transactions that a company conducted during a specific accounting period. On the COA level, CAS and IFRS are different in the classification of accounts. CAS classifies accounts by function, while IFRS classifies accounts by function or by nature. For example, bank charges, are classified as “financial expenses” under CAS while they are usually included in the “administrative expenses” account under IFRS."

Besides, CAS requires a specific account name to be used when recording double entries. For example, for the two sub-accounts under lease liabilities, one is called future lease payables (the undiscounted outstanding rental payment), and another one is called the unrecognized financing charges (the difference between the outstanding rental payment and its present value).

A PEO assumes significant responsibility for employment and tax compliance, whereas an in-house HR team may not handle these extensive compliance and liability responsibilities.",

            "PEO fees vary, often based on either a percentage of the company's payroll or a per-employee-per-month model. The total cost depends on the size of your workforce and the range of services required.",
            "Should I choose a PEO or an Employer of Record (EOR) for my business?",
            "Choosing between a PEO and an EOR depends on your business's needs. If your operations are domestic, a PEO is suitable as it enhances your existing HR functions while ensuring compliance with domestic laws. However, if you're looking to hire internationally, an EOR is more appropriate as it takes full legal responsibility for your international employees and handles global payroll and compliance issues."

            "The Cybersecurity Law of the People’s Republic of China, commonly referred to as the Chinese Cybersecurity Law was enacted by the National People’s Congress to increase data protection, data localization, and cybersecurity, evidently in the interest of national security. The law is part of a wider series of laws passed by the Chinese government to strengthen national security legislation. This law requires network operators to store select data within China and allows Chinese authorities to conduct spot-checks on a company’s network operations. The law has several key provisions: It created the principle of cyberspace sovereignty. It defined the security obligations of internet products and service providers. It detailed the security obligations of internet service providers. It further refined rules surrounding personal information protection. It established a security system for key information infrastructure. It instituted rules for the transnational transmission of data from critical information infrastructures. The cybersecurity law applies to network operators and businesses in critical sectors. The Cybersecurity Law specifies two primary categories that businesses need to be aware of: The first is network operators, which according to the law includes entities that require internet access for business purposes, including ownership of or provision of services that require the leading obligation for network users to maintain security measures. The second type is critical information infrastructure operators (CII Operators) and owners and managers of networks. These users have more serious responsibilities, including stricter controls on data collection and storage. More tightly regulated cross-border data transfer and data localization rules are among the sensitive compliance issues for these entities. To transfer data abroad, those subject to restrictions must undertake a security review, proof of commercial need for the data, and finally gain clearance for the transfer of data. Without clearance, all data generated within China must remain within China. Penalties for not complying with the Cybersecurity Law include: Warnings; Demands to make a correction; Fines; Public announcements of the misconduct; Negative national credit recordings; Civil liability; Closing of websites; and, Revocation of the business license, depending on the severity of the infraction."

            "China's Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) has significantly evolved, setting stringent guidelines for the handling and transfer of personal and sensitive information within and beyond its borders. This law aligns with international data protection standards like the GDPR, emphasizing consent, transparency, and security in data processing. It categorizes personal information broadly and introduces specific protections for sensitive data, including financial and biometric data, mandating explicit consent and robust security measures for handling such information. Organizations operating in China must navigate these regulations carefully, ensuring compliance to avoid severe penalties. The legal landscape for cross-border data transfer (CBDT) remains dynamic, with the new regulations easing the requirements for data export by adjusting thresholds triggering security assessments or the need for standard contracts or PI protection certification. Notably, it increases thresholds for security assessments, such as transferring non-sensitive personal information (PI) offshore from 100,000 to 1 million individuals' PI, and shortens the period for cumulative PI assessment. It adjusts thresholds for standard contracts or PI protection certification, with requirements now based on cumulative PI transferred since January 1 of the current year. However, organizations must stay vigilant, adapting to ongoing regulatory changes and preparing for future compliance requirements. This includes: Understanding the CBDT activities; Engaging in security assessments when required; and, Fulfilling documentation and filing procedures stipulated by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC). To remain compliant with PIPL, organizations must conduct Personal Information Protection Impact Assessments (PIPIAs), especially when dealing with sensitive information or engaging in activities that significantly affect individuals. They must also adhere to data localization requirements and navigate the complexities of transferring personal information across borders with due diligence."

They are all state-owned entities (SOEs) and each of them acts essentially as a monopoly within their respective markets. Connection speeds tend to vary according to location. China has three submarine optic fibre entry/exit points for all internet traffic. They are located in Qingdao, Shanghai, and Shantou. Since there are only three entry/exit points for international internet access, this creates a bottleneck for all users within China connecting to foreign-hosted sites. To avoid low connection speeds, it is ideal to operate with the highest speed provider in your location. Generally speaking, China Telecom is the most reliable ISP for international internet access in south China, China Unicom in the north, and China Mobile in central/eastern China."

This route offers distinct advantages: Flexibility: You have the option to mirror your existing site or create a new one specifically for your Chinese audience, tailoring your approach to fit your business model and service offerings. Optimized performance: Hosting in mainland China means your services are physically closer to your audience, ensuring faster load times and smoother user experiences. A local CDN can further enhance this, placing your content on equal footing with top-tier Chinese websites. Reduced censorship risks: A valid ICP license minimizes the chances of your content being blocked by the Great Firewall, provided you adhere to local content regulations. However, the ICP license requirement is exclusively available to companies that can navigate the complexities of obtaining an ICP license in China. This option is highly recommended for businesses prioritizing minimal latency and peak performance and those willing to undertake the process of acquiring an ICP license."

            "Navigating issues related to the Great Firewall of China effectively requires the strategic use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), a common tool in the country's digital landscape which nonetheless exists within a complex legal framework. Despite the country's stringent restrictions on VPN services and the blocking of many VPN providers, it remains legal for consumers to use VPNs that are operational within China. The Chinese government officially prohibits the use of any VPNs that have not received government approval. For a VPN to be approved, it must grant the government backdoor access, compromising the security of the service. The enforcement of this regulation primarily targets companies and corporations, not individual users. While there have been instances where Chinese citizens have faced penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment for creating or distributing unauthorized VPNs, with sentences varying from three days to over five years, these measures are applied inconsistently. The market is flooded with free VPN services; however, caution is advised. These free options often monetize by harvesting user data, posing significant privacy risks. It's crucial to understand that the absence of a monetary cost upfront does not guarantee security or privacy. VPN connections in China are subject to fluctuations, particularly during politically sensitive periods or anniversaries, when authorities might tighten access to foreign internet resources. These disruptions can manifest as reduced connection speeds or complete service outages, affecting VPN reliability unpredictably. Given this reality, businesses depending on VPNs for critical operations should develop robust contingency plans to mitigate potential disruptions. All VPN users in China need to anticipate and plan for possible productivity impacts due to service slowdowns or interruptions, ensuring continuity and efficiency in their digital communications and workflows."

Did You Know ERP systems are particularly useful for SMEs where senior staff is located outside of China, as it allows them to have a greater real-time view of how the company is functioning. ERP systems customized for China offer further benefits. For accounting processes undertaken in China’s jurisdiction, China’s generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) must be adhered to. Many Western ERP systems and tax software, however, do not offer functionalities for China’s tax and accounting system. Moreover, ERP systems in China must comply with China’s data regulation framework since such systems often handle sensitive personal data.

Now, as China is tasked with rebuilding and reorganizing its healthcare system, the government has started to signal its priorities for the next era of its healthcare transformation. Battling the pandemic has caused China to rethink its priorities within the healthcare system – pushing critical health infrastructure, digital services, and public health promotion much higher on the list than if the infectious outbreak had not occurred. In this three-part series we will take a look at the changes that are taking place in the healthcare industry in China in the following key health sectors: Telemedicine and digital healthcare, Medical devices, Pharmaceutical industry. In part one of the series, we provide an overview of China’s healthcare industry before diving into the growth and investment opportunities in the country’s emerging telemedicine and digital healthcare industry as well as the regulations facilitating their rise."

            "China healthcare industry is currently ranked the second largest in the world behind the US. The market has grown at a consistently rapid rate in the past five years, and in 2019, the market reached RMB 7.82 trillion (US$1.1 trillion), an increase of 10 percent when compared to that from the previous year. Despite this, the market remains relatively undeveloped, with China’s health expenditure – including pharmaceuticals, medical devices, distribution, hospital, pharmacies and insurance – accounting for only 6.57 percent of the total GDP in 2018, while the US reached 17.8 percent in the same year. Given that many countries will see their GDP contract in 2020 due to COVID-19, this will impact the government’s total expenditure – of which a set sum is allocated to healthcare expenditure. However, analysts estimate that China’s GDP will grow somewhere between to in 2020, with healthcare spending projected to rise too, albeit at slower rates than in 2019. Thus, the market presents considerable opportunities for growth, particularly as the Chinese government has more recently laid out multiple initiatives to support long-term growth and innovation in healthcare delivery, it is likely that healthcare will feature even more heavily in the 14th Five Year Plan (covering 2021-25) than it did in the 13th Five Year Plan."

New raw material for the production of vaccines as well as medical institutions are now an encouraged investment sector by the central government, unlocking opportunities for foreign investors to access preferential policies and tax rates.

            "Prior to the outbreak, most Chinese consumers typically visited physical medical institutions for their healthcare needs. Though digital adoption was a much talked about concept, the actual digital penetration rate was relatively low. According to the survey completed by Bain & Company, in 2019, only 24 percent of Chinese respondents had used telemedicine, which is the use of technology to provide remote clinical services. However, as an inevitable consequence of COVID-19, there has been a rapid acceleration of the wide-spread adoption of digital technology in both the delivery of healthcare services (remote patient monitoring, online booking, and telemedicine) and the digitally assisted delivery in healthcare services (artificial intelligence, machine learning for diagnostics and treatment, augmented reality or AR surgeon training, robotic and AI assistance)."

            "In fact, during the COVID-19 outbreak, the country’s National Health Commission (NHC) promoted the use of internet-based medical services to minimize population movements and reduce the risk of infection. This led to the exponential increase in the user base and engagement of China’s online medical platforms. For example, Ping An Good Doctor – China’s largest healthcare platform – experienced a 900 percent surge in new users, and 800 percent surge in online consultations during the period of December 2019 to January 2020. Though the need for remote healthcare delivery was clear during the epidemic, there are fundamental reasons why this model is here to stay. The pandemic both exacerbated and shone light on the pervasive bottleneck within China’s healthcare provider system, which consistently obstructed easy access to quality healthcare services. China has a tiered healthcare system in which smaller community health centers (CHCs) and Class I institutions provide first-contact care, and larger Class II and III institutions provide specialist referral services. However, in practice, the provision of healthcare is extremely unbalanced with more than running at capacity while the remaining low-tier hospitals, community health centers, and clinics struggle to attract patients. In response, online healthcare platforms are expected to continue to grow against the backdrop of a congested and unbalanced healthcare provider system to create a more patient-centric engagement model, as seen below."

            "Though telemedicine is not a new concept in China, it has only recently started to adopt a more cohesive and regulated approach to this sub sector – most crucially supporting the digitalization of both the infrastructure and the administrative (licenses and insurance) landscape. In 2019, the National Healthcare Security Administration (NHSA) the electronic medical insurance system – regulating the prices and insurance policies to allow for internet-based medical services to be covered by the country’s medical insurance system. Starting from August 2019, patients able to access to diagnosis and prescription services from hospitals via WeChat and Alipay without bringing any medical insurance identity cards, thus promoting the widespread adoption of telemedicine. Also, notably, in May 2020, the NHC encouraged provincial governments to establish their own online regulatory platforms to oversee and regulate individual online medical providers and to accelerate the market access of internet-based hospitals. This was backed up by a notice which will take effect August 2020, officially introducing the use of electronic licenses and certificates for medical institutions, nurses, and doctors. Collectively, these reforms have allowed medical institutions to more readily adopt telemedicine services. However, currently the legal framework only accounts for physical medical institutions in mainland China, and no legal framework exists for internet-based cross-border medical activities provided by foreign medical institutions from overseas to Chinese domestic patients. Below we highlight some of the new regulations released by the central government to allow telemedicine to grow to scale, adding new opportunities for existing and new healthcare market players."

However, the outbreak has caused a massive acceleration in the use of telehealth services – prompting healthcare providers, patients, and insurers to adopt telehealth tools much more readily than before. One of the major tipping points to facilitate the rise of digital healthcare is the shift in consumer attitudes towards online platforms. According to a survey by Bain & Company, Chinese patients are much more open and indeed expectant of higher uses of digital health services within the next five years. While this applies to telemedicine, which recorded an exponential growth of more than 164 percent, there is also now a higher acceptance of digitalization of healthcare services across the board including: online long-term illness management, digital records, on-demand services, and health/life insurance apps."

Equally, medical technology (MedTech) companies and software as a service (SaaS) businesses, are well-positioned to partner with offline healthcare providers to transition into more innovative business-to-consumer (B2C) healthcare delivery models to provide a more holistic and comprehensive care. Digitized health services are still at a relatively early stage of development but represent one of the largest potential areas of growth in the healthcare sector. With the coming adoption of 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT), support for digitized healthcare and telemedicine will continue to be a point of emphasis for government planners in the coming years."

In this regard, foreign investment in Tianjin benefits from relevant national policies and regulations and local foreign investment policies issued by the Tianjin authorities. Local supportive policy goals include: Implement the financial industry opening policy: relax restrictions on foreign-funded banking business. Optimize foreign investment policies in the automotive sector: ensure that domestic and foreign auto manufacturers produce new energy vehicles enjoy the same market access treatment. Optimize scientific and technological innovation services for foreign-invested enterprises: insist that domestic and foreign enterprises are treated equally and encourage and support foreign-funded enterprises to apply for high and new technology enterprise status. Strengthen policy publicity and interpretation: make full use of government and departmental portals, \"Policy One-Touch\" service platform and other channels to make sure the policies released are accessible to the vast majority. Reduce the cost of using capital across borders of funds: support foreign-invested enterprises in the Tianjin Pilot Free Trade Zone to handle cross-border RMB receipts and payments through Free Trade (FT) accounts. The FT account is an account with the integration of local currency and foreign currency opened in the FTZ, which can help enterprise achieve convenient conversion between RMB and foreign exchange in this single account, without the need of opening other foreign exchange accounts. Make it more convenient for expatriates working in China: relax the age requirements for foreign talents who come to Tianjin to invest and optimize the process of work permits application. Optimize the approval procedures for land use application for foreign-funded projects: simplify the application approval materials and shorten the approval time."

            "Navigating China's intricate F&B regulatory system stands paramount in safeguarding the quality and safety of imported food products. Despite this rigorous framework, a substantial volume of food imports face rejection or destruction annually due to non-compliance or irregularities in quality. This not only incurs losses for both importing and exporting enterprises but can also lead to severe consequences like license revocation and future trade exclusion. With these high-stakes scenarios in mind, companies must remain vigilant, keeping up-to-date with evolving food regulations, and ensuring that their products align with essential import procedures."

By 2022, this figure surged to US$110 billion. Key F&B exporters to China include Brazil, the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. China's growing and evolving appetite for imported F&B aligns with its transition toward consumption-driven economic growth. As of 2021, China imported 2,938 types of foods from 184 countries and regions."

            "Foreign exporters usually adopt two ways to get goods to China: general trade export or cross-border e-commerce (CBEC). In either model, all exporters and importers of foreign F&B must be recorded through the “Registration Systems of Imported Food and Cosmetic Importers and Exporters” or the “Internet + customs platform” of the GACC. If the foreign exporter wants to choose a Chinese importer of record to conduct customs clearance (and quarantine if required), the exporter is advised to use China’s to gather basic official information about the prospective importer or review the importer’s performance via a public register maintained by the GACC. In addition, some of the food products that have heightened safety requirements, such as meat and health products, require additional registration. In addition, manufacturers of the following product groups must be recommended by the relevant authority in the country/region they’re established in: Casings; Aquatic products; Dairy products; Bird’s nests and bird’s nest products; Bee products; Eggs and egg products; Edible oils and fats; Oilseeds; Stuffed pastry products; Edible grains, milled grain industry products, and malt; Fresh and dehydrated vegetables; Dried beans; Condiments; Nuts and seeds; Dried fruits; Unroasted coffee and cocoa beans; and Foods for special dietary purposes and functional foods. In this case, the foreign manufacturer of the product must register with China’s Certification and Accreditation Administration. If the foreign manufacturer is deemed as meeting Chinese registration requirements, it will be publicly listed on the CNCA website. The registration will be valid for four years and is extendable. In addition, from January 1, 2022, the CNCA registration number must be printed on the Chinese label of the imported food product. Further, to be noted, as of , it is mandatory for exporters to register each shipment of food products online with the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection, and Quarantine (AQSIQ) department for tracking purposes."

            "The GACC released the Measures for the Safety Administration of Imported and Exported Food (GAC Decree No.249) and the Administrative Provisions on Registration of Overseas Manufacturers of Imported Food (GAC Decree No.248) on April 12, 2021. Both regulations took effect on January 1, 2022, enacting stricter regulations on food imports. Some notable changes include: Expansion of registration scope: Previously, only manufacturers of certain products like meat, aquatic, dairy, birds’ nest, and bee products needed to register. The new rule extends registration requirements to companies involved in processing and storing these items for export to China. Registration methods: The old requirement for foreign producers to be registered by their country's authority has been replaced. Now, the registration method varies based on the product category. Low-risk products can be self-applied or assisted by agencies. Streamlined application materials: Some documentation like animal and plant epidemic info, health requirements, and layout details are no longer needed after a food safety evaluation. The audit report and company identification documents remain mandatory. Enhanced registration approvals: The GACC can assemble experts or agents to assess applications. Teams of at least two members can use materials, video inspections, on-site visits, or a combination thereof for assessments. Clearer registration number rules: Registered companies must now display the registration number on both inner and outer packaging, following Chinese or competent authority-approved registration numbers. Dietary supplement labeling: Dietary supplements must feature labels in Chinese on their sales packaging. Extended registration validity: Registration validity and renewal are now extended to 5 years, aligning with domestic Chinese food production licenses. Renewal requirements: Renewal-related proof materials must be provided for GACC approval. Major changes like production site, legal representative, or foreign registration number necessitate reapplication, invalidating the previous Chinese registration number. Validity extension application: Applying for validity extension mandates submission of an application form and statement to the GACC 3-6 months prior to expiration. Strengthened responsibilities: The new regulation empowers competent authorities to suspend exports to China and demand immediate corrective actions if any issues are detected, surpassing the previous approach limited to unqualified registered companies. Limited competent authorities: While the previous rule included various institutions, the new definition narrows down competent authority to the official department overseeing safety and health of the producer's country."

            "Distribution channels",
            "When it comes to exporting goods to China, the process involves a series of intermediaries. This includes import agents and distributors, as well as wholesalers and sub-distributors, who play pivotal roles in facilitating the flow of products. In comparison to other markets, the distribution setup in China unfolds as a complex journey, shaped by distinct import regulations and product categories. Each product type requires specific import licenses or permits, with wine, dairy, meat, seafood, and fruits mandating specialized licenses. Traditionally, many food distributors or traders lacked import licenses. Instead, licensed importers took charge of import procedures and clearance on behalf of third-party distributors. However, times are changing. A shift is occurring with more distributors stepping into the role of import agents or wholesale players, boasting networks of sub-distributors they've nurtured. Notable names like Sam’s Club, Metro, and Yonghui, alongside other supermarket giants, are authorized to directly import goods from international suppliers. In the realm of F&B, distributors, and retailers reign supreme in specific localities and seldom enjoy national coverage. Selecting partners strategically and pinpointing the right location becomes paramount. A multi-faceted approach, blending online and offline strategies, proves effective. Chinese partners often seek exclusive product rights, but granting exclusivity hinges on comprehensive insights into their sector expertise, import capabilities, existing relationships, and distribution networks."

            "The Port of Qingdao is one of the 10 busiest seaports in the world. To this day the city relies heavily upon its blue economy, in particular container shipping and other traditional maritime industries, such as oil and fishing. During the 13th Five Year Plan period (2016 to 2020), the city’s gross ocean product (GOP) grew an average of over 13 percent annually. By 2020, Qingdao reported a GOP of RMB 358 billion (US$55.4 billion), accounting for 28.9 percent of the local GDP. Maritime industries are still a key area for growth. The city received RMB 300 million (US$46.4 million) in national funds during the 13th FYP to become one of the first maritime innovation development demonstration cities, under which 35 demonstration projects were established. Today, industries such as shipbuilding, offshore engineering, and shipping and logistics are modernizing fast. The city has built a number of fully automated shipping terminals, powered by hydrogen energy, 5G technology, and automated guided vehicles. The mainstay industry of aquaculture is also becoming smarter. To feed China’s appetite for seafood, Qingdao is shifting focus to experimental fishing and farming technologies. These include new mechanisms such as deep-sea fish farming, as well as the application of the Internet of Things (IoT) and other new technologies to enhance farming efficiency. Other emerging sectors include seawater desalination, an important industry for a country likely to face critical water shortages in the coming decades. Qingdao was responsible for one seventh of the seawater desalinated in China in 2020 and has the capacity to process approximately 224,000 cubic meters of water per day. Marine biomedicine has received a significant amount of attention in recent years, and a ‘Blue Drug Bank’ development plan for marine biomedicine received RMB 5 billion (US$773.2 million) in investment through the ‘Blue Drug Bank development fund’ during the 13th FYP period. The government has set out several development goals for different marine industries, pending revisions based on public opinion. These include maintaining the annual growth rate of the GOP at eight percent and for it to make up 33 percent of the local GDP by 2025. Other specific goals include increasing desalination output to 500,000 cubic meters per day and for port cargo throughput to reach 680 million tons, all of which will require significant investment and technological advancement."

            "As Qingdao’s economy continues to modernize and mature, tertiary sectors are playing an increasingly important role in the city’s growth. The service industry surpassed 60 percent of the local GDP for the first time in 2019 and climbed further to 61.4 percent by the end of 2020. The local government is keen to keep this momentum going and has highlighted a number of sectors for development. Focus is now on developing two main areas of the tertiary industry: modern services, such as finance, logistics, boutique tourism, business services, and manufacturing-related producer services. To boost the producer service sector, Qingdao recently approved the creation of the first pilot zone for “integrating the two industries” and designated Haier Group among the project’s pilot companies. In the coming years, the Qingdao government seeks to expand industry clusters for key sectors, which are located in a number of different dedicated development zones and parks across the city. These cover finance, logistics, culture and creativity, and digital information, as well as emerging sectors, such as healthcare, technology services, e-commerce, business services, and energy conservation and environmental protection."

            "As China’s largest municipality by size and population, Chongqing ranks as the fifth Chinese city with the , following Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou. The city recorded a GDP of RMB 2.5 trillion (US$385.5 billion) in 2020. For perspective, that’s about the size of Israel’s or Argentina’s economy. Chongqing’s economy was formerly based on agriculture and heavy industry, but is now more balanced, with the secondary and tertiary industries contributing to 40.0 percent and 52.8 percent of its GDP. Over the last two decades, its GDP per capita has increased 16-fold, from US$544 to US$8,908, and the urbanization rate has doubled from 29.5 percent to 62.2 percent, according to the World Bank. In the rapid urbanization process, however, Chongqing has avoided some major challenges faced by first-tier Chinese cities, such as high cost of living and scarcity of affordable housing. In 2020, Chongqing logged total imports and exports of US$94.2 billion, up 12.5 percent, which is 10.9 percentage points higher than the national average growth rate. This province-like city ranked 12th in terms of total import-export volume among 31 Chinese provinces. The US, Hong Kong, and Germany are the top three destinations of Chongqing’s goods exports, while Taiwan, Vietnam, and South Korea are top countries or regions from where Chongqing imports goods."

Chongqing is doubling down on developing its electronics industry, which maintained strong growth momentum, growing 13.9 percent last year. Chongqing’s has formed an electronics industry pattern dominated by three industrial clusters: integrated circuit (IC), display panel, and intelligent terminal. Dubbed “Chicago in Yangtze River”, Chongqing is also putting efforts into upgrading its conventional pillar industry – automobile manufacturing. Leveraging its existing automobile base, Chongqing endeavors to become a global leader in producing and using new energy vehicles, including electric cars. Last year, BYD, China’s leading electric automaker backed by Warren Buffett, decided to build its in Chongqing that produces the BYD Blade Battery. The project is expected to invest no less than RMB 20.5 billion (US$3.2 billion).

The FTZ is equipped with world-class infrastructure and is home to a well-established service sector, which creates a quarter of the city’s GDP and about 40 percent of China’s total foreign trade. Certain types of foreign businesses and organizations operating in China are only permitted to set up within the Shanghai FTZ area. The FTZ itself has been gradually expanding – covering an area of 28.78 square kilometers in 2013 to 240.22 square kilometers in 2019. The Lingang New Area – which was established in 2019 – is a special economic function zone of the Shanghai FTZ. Spanning 119.5 square kilometers along the southeastern tip of Shanghai, it aims to facilitate free activities in trade, investment, finance, talents, and information – with a special focus on stimulating new high-tech innovation and cross-border exchange of financial and legal services. The goal is to establish a relatively mature system of investment and trade and more open functional platforms by 2025 and become a special economic function zone with strong global market influence and competitiveness by 2035 – expanding to new areas, such as Shanghai Dazhi river, Jinhui Port, Xiaoyangshan Island, and the southern part of Pudong International Airport."

To this end, a set of guidelines released on July 15, 2021 proposed a 15 percent corporate income tax (CIT), reduced from the national standard of 25 percent, for companies engaged in these four sectors in “specific areas” of Pudong.

The recent outbreak of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in Shanghai - the most severe the city has seen - led to a two-month lockdown starting on April 1, 2022. The COVID-19 restrictions have had a considerable impact on the city leading to a near economic standstill, casing businesses and people across the city hard. The central government, along with key departments such as the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and State Tax Administration (STA), has released several nationwide relief and stimulus measures to boost economic growth. Notable measures include VAT credit rebates for small businesses and industries that have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 containment measures, CIT reductions for low-profit enterprises, fee cuts, tax deferments for small manufacturing businesses, and reduction of operating costs, among many others. On May 29, 2022, a few days before Shanghai lifted its city-wide lockdown, the government released a set of 50 support measures to help restart the economy. Many of the relief measures are targeted at businesses and hard-hit sectors, such as catering, retail, travel and tourism, and manufacturing. The support policies include expansions of previous tax relief measures, rent waivers, fee cuts, and reduction of operating costs."

It is impractical and unwise to include these extensive guidelines in individual labor contracts.

With an area of 4,223 square kilometers, Jiaxing is surrounded by Suzhou to the north, Shanghai to the east, Hangzhou and Huzhou to the west, and Hangzhou Bay to the south. In terms of infrastructure, Jiaxing is well developed with a deep-water port, high-speed rail links, and six expressways linking to the wider Yangtze River Delta region. The Chinese Academy of Social Science ranked Jiaxing the 37th in China in 2021, a standing that reflects the significant improvement made over recent years. A push by the local government to shift away from traditional resource-heavy manufacturing and towards a more high-tech and environmentally friendly economy has led to a range of diverse industries in Jiaxing. These industries, and several special development zones within the city, present investment opportunities for foreign firms who are looking to expand their operations in China."

Traditional industries in Jiaxing include the production of textiles and clothing, leather products, and chemical fibers. In recent years, these have been overtaken by high-tech industries, such as electronics manufacturing and software development. For example, the so-called Jiaxing Science City (which includes the Jiaxing Nanhu Hi-Tech Industrial Park and the Zhejiang Nanhu Economic Development Zone), hosts several industries specializing in health and biomedicine (biological drugs, chemical drugs, medical equipment), microelectronics (semiconductors, intelligent terminals), and intelligent equipment manufacturing sectors. Further, the Jiaxing Municipal government has highlighted “new energy”, “new materials”, and “energy efficiency and environment protection” as emerging strategic industries with the objective of “creating a more eco-friendly, innovative, and intelligent” city. A key growth driver in these industries is the Zhejiang Institute of Advanced Technology, which runs multiple RMB-100-million- research and development (R&D) projects focused on sustainable energy. In addition, a number of development zones have been set up in the city to attract companies that develop photovoltaic products, which turn solar energy into electricity. Thanks to all these combined factors, in 2021 Jiaxing's for the secondary industry scored 88.1, an increase of 4.8 points compared to the previous year, ranking fourth in the province overall."

The QFLP program gives international institutional investors and private equity fund managers better treatment and more access to China's domestic private equity market. Under the pilot program, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise or a Sino-foreign joint venture created by a foreign private equity fund manager is eligible to raise money through a partnership and make domestic investments. Being a center of high-quality foreign investment in Zhejiang, Jiaxing is anticipated to optimize the capital market environment and promote industry transformation and upgrading by piloting the QFLP. The city has planned to test the program in Jiashan county and take advantage of Nanhu Fund Town (China’s first private equity fund town) to promote foreign investment in the local capital market and encourage more businesses to go public through equity investment."

            "The concept of self-driving cars has captured people’s imaginations for decades. Proponents of the technology paint a vision of how it will transform the way humans live and travel, helping to ease congestion, reduce emissions, and even save lives. 2021 was the oft-cited year for the arrival of self-driving cars, but this reality has failed to materialize. Even as the technology improves, the long-awaited launch date gets pushed further and further into the future as technological bottlenecks, irregular transport infrastructure, and public unease hamper the technology's uptake. Skeptics have argued that even if it becomes possible for fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) to safely drive on public roads, it will be many decades down the road. This uneven and unpredictable development of the industry and lack of a timeline for profit-making has made many investors think twice and resulted in an increasingly ambivalent media and public. But whereas the hype surrounding AVs already peaked a few years ago in the U.S. and other western countries, in China, it is still on the rise. China's self-driving car industry is brimming with optimism; a new generation of upstarts are receiving significant investor attention and established technology companies and traditional automakers alike are jumping on the bandwagon. This optimism also has state backing - the Chinese government is actively promoting the industry through policy incentives and development initiatives, wanting to ensure that if and when autonomous driving takes off, China and Chinese companies will be on the front foot. Meanwhile, new regulations serve to legitimize the sector and standardize its products, providing a more concrete legal framework for both operators and investors to work within."

Management consultancy firm McKinsey has predicted that highly autonomous vehicles will see . The firm also expects that the uptake of AVs will cause a shift toward a service-oriented passenger vehicle market, focused on mobility services, and away from a product-oriented market, focused on private car sales. The extremely high costs of developing and deploying the technology, as it currently stands, will also help to drive the AV market in the direction of mobility services. Most consumers will not be able to purchase a fully autonomous car but could still afford to enjoy its benefits through taxi or bus services, which would be able to run 24/7 as the human driver is taken out of the equation.",
            "This reflects the current development of the industry, with many companies largely focusing on developing ‘robotaxis’ and autonomous passenger busses. Some companies have already begun rolling out trial robotaxiand bus services in urban areas in China. This presents possibly the biggest opportunity for autonomous driving in China. Information provider and analytics firm IHS Markit predicts that China’s shared mobility market will reach a valuation of RMB 2.25 trillion (US$352 billion) by 2030, or a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20 to 28 percent. If AVs can penetrate this market, the rewards may be enormous. For lower-level AVs, adoption may be even higher. IHS Markit predicts that 80 percent of new vehicles will have some automated capabilities by the end of the decade. It will therefore be almost a prerequisite for a vehicle to have some autonomous capabilities in order to be competitive."

            "Fully automated driving",
            "As has been discussed above, fully autonomous vehicles are unlikely to hit the road for commercial use until at least the end of the decade. In its report, McKinsey cited technology bottlenecks and unstandardized transport infrastructure as reasons for this extended timeline. China also currently falls behind other countries in several fields, such as computing platforms, sensors, AV system integration, and more. China is therefore keen to solve these technical issues and catch up with other markets, which will require a large amount of investment in software development and technological R&D, as well as rigorous testing and assessment. Many of these fields are also encouraged for foreign participation, as listed in the above catalogue. The high cost and as-yet uncertain return on investment of this sector mean that the space is currently dominated by the internet giants (Baidu, Tencent, and Alibaba, to name some of the biggest players), established traditional automakers, or upstarts that are backed by these companies.",
            "Baidu, for example, is one industry frontrunner, having launched free trials of its Baidu Apollo robotaxi service in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, and earlier in 2021 becoming the first company to get approval to charge fares for a fully driverless robotaxi service in a closed park in Beijing. Didi Chuxing, China’s dominant ride-hailing platform, also established an autonomous driving arm in 2016 and has launched road tests in several Chinese cities Alibaba, meanwhile, has thrown its weight behind AutoX, which has received licenses to conduct road tests in several cities across China, including Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Shanghai, among others. Baidu Apollo, Didi Chuxing, and AutoX have all received licenses to conduct road tests in California. Several foreign automakers are also investing in Chinese AV upstarts. Toyota currently backs Pony.ai, which was the first company in China to launch road tests, GM recently invested US$300 million in Momenta, and Nissan has bet on WeRide."

            "With the large-scale commercialization of fully autonomous vehicles still uncertain, many players are dipping their feet in peripheral applications and industries. Although not technically ‘autonomous’, low-level automation in passenger vehicles also forms an important part of China’s autonomous driving vision and is becoming increasingly common. Many new car models are offered with ADAS or autonomous parking functions. According to , one of China’s leading outlets for news on the auto market, over 25 percent of new passenger vehicles sold in 2020 had low-level (L2 and below) automated driving capabilities. This scene is dominated by automakers and electric vehicle companies. The most notable foreign company in this space is Tesla, whose China-made electric vehicles offer automated features such as driver-assist and automated parking. In many cases, autonomous systems are developed for carmakers by third-party companies specializing in the technology. Baidu Apollo, for example, in addition to its robotaxi ambition, also provides its connected car offerings to Chinese carmaker WM Motor."

            "Autonomous trucks and delivery vehicles",
            "Beyond autonomous cars, interest in automated transport and logistics is rising. This trend may also have been accelerated by the pandemic, which has increased demand for no-contact delivery. The AV industry may also have a strategic role to play in China’s development, helping to answer China’s growing labor problem. China’s shrinking and increasingly well-educated workforce has already begun to impact industries that rely on low-skilled labor, including trucking and transport. Automating these sections of the logistics industry through the use of self-driving vehicles could serve to eventually replace the need for human drivers. This movement has already begun. AVs have been deployed to deliver parcels in university campuses and transport containers in port areas. E-commerce companies, such as JD.com and Alibaba, have developed and begun deploying unmanned delivery vehicles to deliver parcels. The driverless truck industry has also transitioned from the research stage to testing and deployment. Generally considered more commercially viable as trucks are mostly required to drive on highways, which are more uniform and better regulated than smaller roads, many companies are betting big on this field. Autonomous truck start-up Plus recently conducted on the Wufengshan Highway in the Yangtze River Delta, and plans to launch pilot runs of its service in 2022. Meanwhile, Chinese trucking start-up TuSimple recently partnered with U.S. chipmaker NVIDIA to develop autonomous trucks, with the companies saying in a press release that production would begin in 2024. JD Logistics, JD.com’s logistics arm, and meal delivery platform Meituan have also recently , which reached US$270 million."

            "Microchips and sensors",
            "China's self-driving car industry is still reliant on imported technology for certain components as domestic companies play catch-up with global competitors. One of the most important of these is auto chips, a requisite component for even low-level autonomy, and one that is only becoming even more in demand as the technology matures. Foreign companies that produce auto chips for the Chinese market include Germany’s Infineon Technologies, which has a manufacturing plant in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, and the Chinese joint venture of the British microchip design company Arm, which recently announced it would start creating computing units for autonomous driving systems.",
            "Sensors - the technology that enables AVs to 'see' their surroundings - is another field in which foreign companies may have an advantage. The technology in China is still years behind the global frontrunners - according to the McKinsey report - and some domestic developers turn to overseas suppliers. Earlier in 2021, China’s SAIC Motor announced it would use lidar sensors from U.S. start-up Luminar Technologies to power automated driving capabilities in its future car models. However, that is not to say there are no Chinese companies in this field. With lidar set to become a very lucrative industry if AVs take off, tech giants such as Huawei and DJI, the Chinese drone maker, are getting in on the action. China is also home to an increasingly crowded start-up scene, with companies such as XPeng, RoboSense, and Hesai developing offerings."

            "China's self-driving car industry remains relatively unregulated when compared to traditional auto industries. There are currently no nationwide regulations on AVs and only recently did the government release standards on the classification of different levels of autonomous driving. This is partly due to the fact it is still a relatively nascent industry, but the decisions may also be strategic. Authorities have largely chosen to adopt an 'innovate now, regulate later' policy to give companies freer rein to develop and test the technology. This is an important strategic choice that may give Chinese companies an advantage over their competitors in more heavily regulated markets, such as the U.S. and Europe. However, several peripheral and regional regulations and guidelines have been released in recent years, laying the groundwork for the creation of wider laws that could help to focus both the industry and investors."

The Taxonomy of Driving Automation for Vehicles , formulated jointly by 11 major carmakers and suppliers and overseen by the MIIT, classifies six levels of automation, from Level 0 (L0), which has no automated driving capabilities, to Level 5 (L5), which is fully autonomous in all scenarios. Previously, the industry had relied largely on the U.S. classification of automated driving levels. The new standards provide a clearer framework for development and lay a foundation for potential regulations and guidelines in the future. It also sets standards for how vehicles can be marketed, requiring, for example, that L0 to L2 vehicles only be marketed as having 'driver-assist' functions. Many new car models produced and sold in China can be considered to be between L0 and L2 vehicles as they come with features such as emergency braking, park assist, and cruise control.",

Data-guzzling intelligent vehicles are therefore becoming subject to increasing scrutiny and stricter regulations as the authorities seek to improve the safety of the technology and protect user data and national security.",
            "In May 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) began soliciting opinions on a set of trial provisions titled Several Provisions on Vehicle Data Security Management(the ‘provisions’), which outline new requirements for manufacturers and operators of intelligent connected vehicles to protect personal information and 'important' data. The finalized was later released in August 2021 and took effect on October 1, 2021. The provisions define 'personal information' as information from any stakeholders, including car owners, drivers, passengers, and pedestrians, as well as any information from which one can infer the personal identity of a stakeholder or describe their personal behavior. ‘Important’ data includes vehicle data collected from sensitive areas, such as military zones and government agencies, surveying and mapping data of higher precision than that released by official state maps, and any audio or video data collected from outside the vehicle, such as faces, voices, and license plates (this data is collected by vehicle cameras and sensors).",
            "The provisions overlap significantly with the other data legislation. For instance, they require operators to inform users of the data they are collecting and delete it upon their request, while also outlining specific measures for storing the data to ensure its safety. The regulations, as is also stipulated in China’s data security law, require that any data collected in China must be stored in China, and must undergo a security assessment before it can be exported. These requirements are also stipulated in the PIPL, which comes into effect on November 1, 2021.",
            "Existing data laws also place strict security requirements on entities that collect and store data, requirements that have now been expressly extended to intelligent vehicle operators through several official documents. A set of on data management for makers of intelligent connected vehicles and product access released by the MIIT in August 2021 outlines requirements for the storage and protection of personal and core information collected from users in China. The document mandates that companies implement their own data security management systems, appoint personnel responsible for the security management, and carry out security assessments to identify potential threats and risks to cybersecurity. The guiding opinions also reiterate the ban on the export of data collected by vehicles in China without approval from the authorities. These same requirements are stipulated in China’s Cybersecurity Law, Data Security Law, and PIPL, but were previously not expressly extended to vehicles."

Industry players have already come under pressure to comply with newly tightened regulations. Several foreign automakers, including Tesla, Ford, and BMW, have built data centers in China to store data collected from Chinese users in order to comply with data regulations. However, given the government’s eagerness to develop the industry, it remains unlikely that it will regulate it to the extent that it will seriously hinder development.

            "The global auto industry has been hit hard by a worldwide chip shortage, and China is no exception. Several leading automakers have been forced to due to a lack of chips, which are indispensable for almost all modern vehicles, even those with no automated driving features. In China, this issue has been exacerbated by the U.S.-China trade war, which has seen the U.S. ban exports of microchips to companies on the Entity List. The trade war may make it increasingly difficult for U.S. companies to supply chips to Chinese AV developers, further exacerbating the chip crunch and hampering industry growth. Forecasts for the industry’s development have already been pushed back a couple of years due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which is the primary cause of the chip shortage. To counteract this, several chipmakers, including Taiwan’s , have pledged to open more fabs in China and increase production. At the same time, China is doubling down on its domestic microchip industry. Some players in the market are already developing their own auto chips, such as Baidu, which recently launched its second-generation Kunlun chip for autonomous driving."

Despite China’s population generally being open and accepting of new technology, many people are still wary of entrusting the potential life-or-death task of driving a car to a computer. Concerns over safety features have already impacted automakers, most notably Tesla, which received negative attention in April 2021 after a consumer alleged that a recent crash had been caused by faulty brakes. Strong public relations will therefore be crucial to building trust with consumers, not only for AV operators themselves but also for companies providing core technology, as there is the potential that they also get thrust into the limelight should accidents occur. Tighter government regulations and better oversight may also help to improve the image of AVs, as consumers are generally trusting of the government to ensure security and order. Companies that are seen to actively comply with laws and regulations may therefore be viewed favorably by the public."

In modern times, the city’s trade has shifted to the import and export of commodities such as foodstuffs and crude oil, as well as cross-border e-commerce, in particular electronics. Xiamen was one of the first cities to reopen to foreign trade and investment during China’s reform and opening-up period. In 1981, it was designated as one of just four ‘special economic zones’ (SEZ), areas that are granted looser restrictions on international trade and investment, as well as preferential policies aimed at accelerating development."

The municipal government has also pushed for the development of cross-border e-commerce in recent years and Xiamen has been certified as a cross-border e-commerce pilot zone. Beyond shipping and logistics, the Xiamen FTZ has attracted a wide range of industries, such as financial services, high-end manufacturing, aerospace and aircraft maintenance, and high-tech and emerging industries. The Huli area of the Xiamen FTZ - called the Cross-Strait Trade Center Core Area-Xiamen Xiangyu Free Trade Zone - mainly focuses on international trade-related businesses, such as import and export trade, bonded warehousing, bonded processing, and commodity displays. Now, the area is also striving to develop its modern services industry by focusing on areas such as cross-border e-commerce, cross-strait express delivery, financing and leasing, internet finance, and testing and maintenance of high-tech products, to name a few. The Haicang area of the Xiamen FTZ, - called the Southeast International Shipping Center Port-Xiamen Haicang Free Trade Port Area - specializes in cultivating sectors and services to support the shipping and logistics industry, and has areas dedicated specifically to port operations, distribution and storage, export processing, port inspection, railway unloading, and other supporting services. Major international companies based in the Xiamen FTZ include Honeywell, Swiss logistics company Panalpina, and German automotive components manufacturing company Hella GmbH.

Rather than replacing mainstay industries, the pivot to high-tech and services sectors will help to help modernize the traditional portions of the economy through automation and digitization.

These changes are being encouraged by the government, which sees the continued introduction of foreign capital as an important driver for economic growth as a whole and for developing strategically important industries.

Meanwhile, non-tax revenue has fallen for five consecutive months. However, the growth rate of expenditure on people's livelihoods is relatively high, which reflects the government's focus on social welfare, education, and agricultural and rural development. The continuation of these tax incentives is a positive signal, aiming to create more opportunities in the current economic environment and is expected to provide financial support to companies in related fields, while helping to achieve the government's social and economic development goals."

However, the effectiveness of regulating recommendation algorithms and deep synthesis may be limited when it comes to addressing new concerns arising from information generated by large language models or the increasingly versatile nature of AI tech. This gap could result in certain AI services operating without adequate oversight, potentially leading to unintended consequences.

Below, we present a few highlights: Content moderation: Providers are held accountable as \"content producers\" according to the Generative AI Measures (Article 9). When “illegal content” is identified among users of these services, providers must promptly take actions, including suspending content generation and transmission, taking down the content, and addressing the issue through model optimization. Additionally, providers are required to report such incidents to regulators (Article 14). Training data: The Generative AI Measures require service providers to source data and foundation models from legitimate sources, respect the intellectual property rights of others, and process personal information with appropriate consent or legal basis under Chinese laws. Providers must enhance the quality of training data, striving for “authenticity, accuracy, objectivity, and diversity” (Article 7). During the development stage, providers must establish \"clear, specific, and practical\" labeling rules for the training data. Conducting quality assessments of data labeling and sample verification to ensure the accuracy of labeled content is also required (Article 8). Tagging of generated content: According to Article 12, providers are mandated to add tags to content generated by Generative AI Services, in line with the requirements outlined in the . User protection: The Generative AI Measures encompass various provisions aimed at safeguarding user rights and ensuring their protection of personal information. Providers are mandated not to collect unnecessary personal information and are prohibited from storing input information and usage records in a manner that can identify individual users. Additionally, they are restricted from disclosing users' input information and usage records to third parties (Article 11). Providers must establish a mechanism to receive and address complaints from users. Moreover, any requests made by users for accessing, obtaining copies, correcting, or deleting their personal information should be handled promptly (Articles 11 and 15). Security assessment and filing: Although the Generative AI Measures do not explicitly identify high-risk services, generative AI services associated with public opinion or social mobilization attributes must undergo security assessment and algorithm filing (Article 17). Regulators may target information services enabling public expression and participation in activities, like Internet forums, blogs, chat rooms, public accounts, short videos, and webcasts, in line with other Chinese regulations."

            "The final Generative AI Measures indicate a more flexible and accommodating approach than the draft version. Several requirements from the previous version were removed, such as user profiling prohibition, user real-name verification, and the three-month model optimization training to prevent illegal content generation. A new section was added to place greater emphasis on balancing AI industry development. Several clauses were added throughout the content to promote innovation, development, and security in generative AI. For example, Article 3 demonstrates the country’s attention to development and security, promoting the combination of innovation and legal governance. Effective measures will encourage innovation and development in generative AI while implementing regulation that is tolerant and cautious. This emphasis also aligns with the strategic importance of the AI industry in the era of great power competition. Further, some additional changes include: Alleviated punishments and constraints for platform operators: The Generative AI Measures removed specific fines from the draft, which may reach up to RMB 100,000 (around US$14,000) for violations, and the requirement for platform operators to rectify problematic content within a three-month grace period. Rather, the Generative AI Measures now emphasize the use of secure and trustworthy chips, software, tools, algorithms, and data sources. China's AI developers are encouraged to set standards and promote technological exchange, granting providers more development ownership in products and content. Strengthened language on data privacy and collection: The updated guidelines include a new article on government data requests (Article 19). It stipulates that relevant authorities will supervise and inspect generative AI services based on their responsibilities, while providers must cooperate and adhere to rules regarding training data sources, scale, type, and labeling. Providers are also required to offer explanations of their algorithm mechanisms and provide necessary technology and data support and assistance. Included provision on obtaining official certification: Additionally, an added provision (Article 23) now mandates providers of generative AI services to obtain relevant administrative approvals, following legal and administrative regulations."

            "In the previous article, we analyzed and compared the difference between China’s AI regulation and those of other countries, namely the US and European nations. In comparison, China takes a more niche approach towards AI regulation: the Generative AI Measures target specific applications or manifestations of a technology, different from the , which aims to comprehensively cover all applications of a given technology. China's unique approach to AI governance also centers on specific algorithms, evident in their policy discourse and the decision to make algorithms the fundamental unit for transparency and disclosure via the algorithm registry. For example, companies may need to undergo multiple filings for the same app, each addressing different algorithms used for personalized recommendations, content filtering, and other functions. While these rules impose some limitations on business behaviors, they all carry an encouraging tone that promotes the development of the AI industry. Companies in the industry should also view China as one of the pioneers in AI regulation, rather than perceiving the rules as restrictive. Recently, Elon Musk China's interest in collaborating within an international framework for AI regulation, based on conversations he had in China a few weeks ago. The final Measures now offer a greater role for organizations, enterprises, and academic institutions to research and innovate in the field of AI technology. This expansion opens up more opportunities for enterprise-facing applications as well."

According to data from iResearch, in 2021, the Chinese medical beauty market reached a scale of RMB 227.4 billion (US$32 billion), with a growth rate of 15.1 percent. This growth outpaced the global average, constituting 21.9 percent of the total global medical beauty market. Looking at the yearly compound growth, the Chinese medical beauty market expanded from RMB 84.1 billion (US$11.9 billion) in 2016 to RMB 197.5 billion (US$27.8 billion) in 2020, demonstrating a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28.7 percent. Despite experiencing robust growth in previous years, the industry faced a setback in 2022 due to the impact of pandemic control measures and a high infection rate towards the end of the year. Consequently, consumers' shopping visit frequency and unit prices sharply declined, leading to a stagnation period. Notably, surgical treatments were particularly affected by these circumstances. Nevertheless, industry experts anticipate a significant rebound in 2023, with the overall medical aesthetic market expected to grow by 20 percent. This resurgence is attributed to the post-pandemic recovery in consumer spending habits. Looking beyond this recovery phase, the subsequent four years are anticipated to maintain a healthy CAGR of 15 percent, underscoring a continued positive trajectory for the development of the Chinese medical beauty industry."

            "China's thriving medical beauty industry is primarily concentrated in its most developed provinces. Notably, consumer activity is most pronounced in economically advanced cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, as well as other first-tier and large cities. The industry is marked by intense competition, coupled with a noticeable shift towards domestic substitution. At present, injection components, notably hyaluronic acid and botulinum toxin, occupy over 85 percent of the cosmetic fillers market. The increasing preference for local alternatives in the context of hyaluronic acid is becoming more pronounced, with 18 domestic brands gaining momentum and competing alongside three major foreign competitors. Noteworthy examples of these local alternatives include LG Yvoire by Hua Dong Medicine, Qoovon by Allergan, and ReLan by Goodmede, which have notably emerged as top sellers in the market. Domestic brands like Imeik (爱美客), Huaxi (华熙), and Haohai (昊海) have secured 14 percent, 8.1 percent and 6 percent market shares, respectively. This trend reflects consumers' growing inclination to choose Chinese brands over international ones for their hyaluronic acid-based aesthetic treatments. Meanwhile, as of the end of 2022, the high-end market for botulinum toxin products continues to be dominated by foreign brands. Notably, industry leaders such as Allergan, Dysport by Ipsen (operated exclusively by Goodmede), and Hugel's Letybo position themselves as premium choices, catering to consumers who prioritize top-tier products. While foreign brands continue to dominate the high-end market for botulinum toxin products, Chinese brands are making strides in entering this space. Examples include Imeik's ‘Orangedox’ in collaboration with Hunos and Hua Dong Medicine's (华东医药) ‘Landox’ in partnership with Jetema. Despite being in the early stages of market promotion, these Chinese entrants currently hold relatively lower market shares."

Key consumer demographics insights include: * Wide age spectrum: The allure of medical aesthetic procedures transcends age barriers, with individuals across various age groups actively incorporating these practices into their beauty regimens. This trend signifies a dynamic and inclusive approach to aesthetics across generations. * Dominance of the ‘under-30 demographic’: Notably, young adults under the age of 30 emerge as the predominant consumers, constituting a significant portion of the surveyed medical aesthetic users in China. Generation Z (Gen Z), in particular, is at the forefront of this trend, consistently investing in both personal development and external appearance. * Influence of abundant resources and information on Chinese Gen Z: The affluence of the Gen Z population in China translates into robust purchasing power within the medical beauty market. Leveraging the digital landscape, Chinese Gen Z individuals access a plethora of information channels, cultivating a consumption mindset that prioritizes self-improvement and comprehensive personal development. * Increase in male consumers: Recent years have witnessed a significant uptick in male consumers engaging with the medical beauty industry.

In 1994, the Ministry of Health published the Directory of Diagnostic and Treatment Subjects for Medical Institutions officially designating the 'Medical Aesthetic Department' as a 'Level One Diagnostic and Treatment Subject' within medical institutions. Moreover, the ministry introduced the Basic Standards for Medical Institution outlining the initial standards for the medical aesthetic industry and related organizations. Following this, a series of regulations and guidelines have been gradually introduced. These include norms for institutional operations, standards for medical beauty services, and strengthening industry supervision. Recent examples are detailed in the table below. Regulations and Guidelines for China’s Medical Beauty Industry --- Time | Plan/Policy | Key objectives 2021 | Initiative on Regulating Financial Products and Financial Services Related to Medical Beauty 《关于规范医疗美容相关金融产品和金融服务的倡议》 Available | Promoting the development of financial products and services related to medical beauty and preventing practices such as “inducing consumers to over-borrow”. 2022 | The 14th Five-Year Plan for the Construction of the Chinese Medical Beauty Standard System 《中国医疗美容标准体系建设“十四五”规划》 Available | Objectives include, among others: * Establishing standardized practices in the medical beauty industry to address issues like fraud and false advertising * Ensuring regulatory compliance and quality management * Controlling risks * Preventing medical incidents 2022 | 2022 Medical Aesthetics Institution Standardized Operations Guidelines 《2022 年医疗美容机构规范运营指南》 Available | Amidst the sector's exponential growth driven by unprecedented consumer demand, objectives involve: * Curbing the rampant malpractices * Ensuring transparency * Aligning with regulatory standards It is important to note that, since 2021, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) released guidelines categorizing medical beauty advertising as equivalent to medical advertising. This move places medical beauty advertisers under the same regulatory scrutiny as their medical counterparts, requiring them to obtain special licensing before disseminating advertisements. The newly introduced Medical Beauty Advertising Law Enforcement Guide emphasizes the need for standardization and consumer protection. To comply with the regulations, medical beauty advertisers must acquire a license for advertising, ensuring that their advertisements adhere to specific guidelines. These guidelines prohibit the promotion of unapproved products, the creation of 'appearance anxiety,' and the disguised presentation of advertisements as interviews or reports."

            "China’s medical beauty industry presents several key challenges, including: * Shortage of professional practitioners: One significant challenge facing the medical beauty industry in China is the shortage of qualified and skilled practitioners. The demand for aesthetic procedures has surged, but there is a notable gap in the number of professionals available to meet this demand. This shortage not only affects the accessibility of services but also raises concerns about the quality of treatments provided. * Lack of comprehensive and institutionalized professional training system: The industry grapples with the absence of a well-established and comprehensive professional training system. While the demand for medical beauty services is escalating, the lack of standardized training programs for practitioners poses a hindrance. A structured training system is crucial to ensure that practitioners acquire the necessary skills, knowledge, and ethical standards, contributing to the overall enhancement of service quality. On the other hand, the sector also seems to present a vast array of opportunities for businesses and investors, including: * Market growth projections: On a more optimistic note, market forecasts paint a picture of substantial growth, with that the industry will exceed RMB 500 billion (US$70.5 billion) by 2028. * Changing consumer dynamics: Consumer attitudes toward medical beauty products and services are undergoing a significant shift. Factors such as rising disposable income, consumer upgrading trends, and the influence of digital marketing have collectively contributed to an increased acceptance of these services. This evolving consumer landscape presents an opportune moment for industry players to tailor their offerings to meet changing preferences. * Innovation and expansion: The industry's dynamism is evident in the continuous innovation of commercialized medical beauty products and the expansion of service offerings. This not only keeps the industry fresh and appealing but also opens avenues for businesses to differentiate themselves through unique and cutting-edge solutions."

At the same time, the country's growing energy demand puts it at odds with these commitments as the country continues to increase the output of coal to a stable power supply. We discuss how far China has come on its road toward decarbonization and the challenges it still faces."

In the run-up to the COP26 summit in early November 2021, China released two key policy documents, further cementing its decarbonization commitments. The two documents, titled the (“Working Guidance”) and the Action Plan for Reaching Carbon Dioxide Peak Before 2030 (“Action Plan”) also form the basis of China’s climate policy framework for reaching its carbon reduction targets, known as the “1+N” policy framework."

Since this humble beginning – churning out and exporting cheap products – Dongguan is now looking to transit into a smart manufacturing base, focused on high-tech robotics and automated equipment. Situated right at the center of the urban agglomeration of the Pearl River Delta region, Dongguan occupies a strategic location. The city falls right between Shenzhen and Guangzhou, benefiting off of a spillover effect from the two megacities in Guangdong province. For example, in 2018, the Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies, headquartered in Shenzhen, opened a high-profile research lab in Dongguan, which accommodates about 25,000 employees, and this was followed by the movement of a number of upstream and downstream companies. Given the robust infrastructure of the Greater Bay Area (GBA), Dongguan is easily accessible. Three of the busiest international airports in southern China – Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, Shenzhen Bao 'an International Airport, and Hong Kong International Airport -- are within an hour from Dongguan. The distance from Dongguan to Hong Kong (about 140 kilometers) is covered by a 30-minutes ride through the Guangdong-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link."

            "Often dubbed China’s Silicon Valley, Shenzhen is China’s fastest-growing city. It is ranked by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences as the mainland’s top city for “overall economic competitiveness” and is China’s premier Special Economic Zone (SEZ) for foreign investment as well as a sub-provincial class city. Shenzhen was declared China’s first SEZ by then-Communist Party (CCP) chairman Deng Xiaoping in 1979. Aided by capital flowing easily from neighboring Hong Kong, the city has since transformed from a small fishing town to a bustling megacity. Every year, millions flock to its city center as part-time or migrant workers, entrepreneurs from around the globe seek to benefit from its investment-friendly practices, and tourists admire its futuristic landscape. Located in Guangdong province only 100 km (62 miles) southeast of its capital, Guangzhou, Shenzhen is strategically located on the Pearl River Delta that serves as a border with Hong Kong. The city center is under 20 minutes from Kowloon by fast train. Other nearby cities include Zhongshan, Dongguan, and Foshan."

Beyond that, foreign investors might need prior approval from the government to invest in restricted markets. For industries not on the negative list, foreign investors shall be treated equally as their domestic counterparts – when accessing the industries, save for record-filing requirements.",

Once a niche concept that can be traced to the cyberpunk novel, Snow Crash, published in 1992, the metaverse has become a buzzword in the last few months and more so since Facebook rebranded itself as Meta on October 28, 2021. To explain in layman's terms, the metaverse is a virtual world that exists in parallel to the physical world. In the metaverse, greater overlap of our digital and physical lives is possible – in the work, socialization, productivity, shopping, and entertainment domains – and is enabled by certain advanced technologies, such as VR, AR, and MR. Businesses, investors, and developers predict it could form the next generation of the Internet. Enabled by specific technologies, the metaverse opens new frontiers for businesses, investors, and developers in many ways. Chinese players are well aware of this, and they have clearly shown their willingness to venture into the virtual world – over 16,000 metaverse-related trademark applications have been filed."

            "Metaverse and the rise of the VR/AR segment Unsurprisingly in China, a wide range of businesses have seized the chance to contribute to the growth of this new market. Chinese investors are seriously working virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) capabilities into their business models and product offerings, and businesses are developing software and hardware for these technologies. Indeed, while China’s tech sector has been experiencing a governmental policy crackdown, domestic VR/AR businesses have so far been unaffected. Six of China's tech giants – including Baidu Inc, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, and Tencent Holdings Ltd (collectively known as BAT) – made it to the top 10 firms worldwide that filed the most VR/AR patent applications in the past two years. In 2019, most of these developments happened in the fields of retail shopping, education, gaming, marketing, information display, and industrial manufacturing. By the end of 2020, China's VR industry alone accounted for about 44 percent of the global market, with an approximate value of US$8 billion. Because big Chinese firms lack the underlying technical expertise required to develop VR devices, these corporations instead pursue a different strategy – investing in startups. The idea is to wait for the dominant headset to emerge by extending its platforms to content developers. In the meantime, another relevant niche has emerged: mobile VR, which represents a key facilitator for innovation in the market. Since the country has over 900 million smartphone users, making VR accessible through smartphones is a priority from a business standpoint. On the other hand, while AR now generates less revenue than VR in China, the market portion is expanding at a faster pace. According to the Internet Society of China, AR revenues, which include hardware, software, content, and services, reached RMB 21.3 billion (US$3.09 billion) in 2021. Feeding this growth phase is China’s accessible technology environment – the country’s largest tech firms provide open platforms and tools for AR developers and content creators. In recent years, several pieces of software and service vendors, such as Sight Plus, Hisense, and Mayitegong, have entered the AR market."

According to a recently published report by Morgan Stanley, Chinese netizens seem to be particularly intrigued by the metaverse (in Chinese: 元宇宙 yuányǔzhòu), and leading Chinese tech firms have already begun to invest in a market that may be worth up to US$8 trillion in the future."

Sounds familiar? The idea was earlier launched by the company and restored with the necessity to resist upcoming competitors in the field. In 2022, an app called Jelly (in Chinese: 啫喱 zhě lí), which is developed and owned by Beijing Yidian Entertainment Technology Co., Ltd., allows users to create online avatars of themselves and engage with up to 50 pals. It surpassed WeChat to become the most downloaded app in China's iOS store on February 8, 2022, becoming the first social media app to beat WeChat in several years. Even though the program encountered delays and crashes due to the large number of users connecting at the same time, leading to the temporary suspension of new account requests, it still represents a valuable lesson for the tech giant on the direction where it is wiser to invest."

            "Chinese consumer behavior towards the metaverse The metaverse continues to pique the imagination of Chinese consumers. According to Newzoo, 78 percent of them are interested in interacting within gaming worlds – in contrast with 57 percent in the United States and 47 percent in the United Kingdom. Moreover, data indicate that 82 percent of those who are interested in the sector also feel very optimistic about the metaverse's potential benefits, and again the numbers sharply surpass those in Western countries. In addition, virtual reality and virtual idols are already booming in China, comprising an industry that is worth RMB 51 billion (US$8 billion) and RMB 3.5 billion (US$548 million), respectively. Their success lies in the fact that Gen-Z consumers relate more easily to these intermediaries, who resemble anime characters that are familiar to them. Moreover, they are also a safer alternative for traditional influencers as they eliminate human errors and they are easier to deal with. This is the case for Ayayi, China’s first meta-human, who was launched in May 2021 by Ranmai Technology and who has already joined Alibaba, recently taking on the role of digital manager of Tmall Super Brand. Another example is Luo Tianyi, a 15-year-old virtual performer, whose Weibo account (@Vsinger_洛天依) reaches more than 5 million followers. In view of this, more companies and content-sharing platforms are employing this medium to attract younger generations of users."

            "Government regulations to watch Since the start of the metaverse fever, several local governments, such as Shanghai, Wuhan, and Hefei, have started to include the topic in their government work reports for 2022. In October 2021, the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR), a think-tank linked to the Ministry of State Security, issued a paper on the metaverse in China warning of the need for lawmakers to deal with virtual crimes. Similarly, in November 2021, the government of Zhejiang province organized a “metaverse industry development symposium”. The topic has also been discussed during the Two Sessions (in Chinese: 两会 liǎnghuì). Specifically, Zheng Xinjian (郑新俭), director of the Fourth Department of the Supreme People’s Procuratorate, during a press conference stressed the importance of protecting users’ privacy and protection from rising online fraud related to the metaverse in China. With reference to the VR/AR sector, in 2018, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) published its Guiding Opinions on Accelerating the Development of the Virtual Reality Industry, a roadmap for the industry that stresses the importance of R&D and content service provision as a foundation for VR development. More recently, the Guangzhou Huangpu District and Guangzhou Development Zone jointly released (also referred to as the “10 Metaverse Measures”), the first policy of its kind in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. Some of the highlights include: Promoting innovation agglomeration and encouraging enterprises to form clusters and become \"highly specialized\"; Supporting technological leadership, where institutions and businesses should work hand in hand to solve technical bottlenecks; Strengthening the protection of intellectual property rights; Increasing talent acquisition; and Establishing a \"Metaverse Industrial Fund\" to attract social capital. It can be seen that the official attitude toward the metaverse is mixed. On the one hand, state-owned think tanks and judicial departments flagged risks for national security in relation to the metaverse. On the other hand, local governments are bolder—they seem to see the metaverse as a powerful technology of great potential and intend to promote the metaverse as a major innovation and revenue source. At the state level, China has not taken any explicit steps to oppose the expansion of the sector in China nor expressed complete support for the metaverse. Considering that China may want to establish its own version of the metaverse that is suited to its economic ambitions, policy directives, and development of homegrown technical expertise, and matches the aspirations of its people, we can cautiously foresee that there will be more concrete regulations to guide the development of the metaverse, like what has happened in the fintech sector. Investors and relevant stakeholders are suggested to pay close attention to the regulatory developments in this area."

            "Less stringent regulations demonstrating the government's commitment to the sector Many positive government efforts linked to the yachting industry and maritime activities, in general, have lately been enacted, and China is seeing a trend of loosening regulations. At the outset of this decade, two regulatory bodies – the Ministry of Transport and the Maritime Safety Administration (MSA) – announced new, more liberalized criteria and standards for yacht registration and overseas-yacht entry/exit procedures. More limitations on boat ownership have been abolished in recent years, and clear maritime traffic legislation has been adopted. The increase of the navigability range, the streamlining of the examination/approval processes, and the inclusion of non-resident yacht registrations are the three most recent major amendments to the rules. These key developments show the government's commitment to the sector's growth. Also, as wealthy Chinese yacht owners spend about 10 percent of the yacht's value on maintenance, a large portion of this wealth is reinvested in the local economy. This not only is a great boost for regional GDP but is also in line with the government’s will of shifting its economy away from production to consumption. It has likely prompted Chinese officials to ease the cumbersome registration process for importing a yacht into the country, as well as the requirements for traveling between provinces. Yachts registered in Hong Kong and Macao, for example, were allowed to sail in China's Pearl River Delta beginning 2018. The first cross-border sailing program has also increased boat orders in the Chinese Mainland by 20 percent to 30 percent. Accordingly, The State Council Office evaluated the in which measures were taken to improve the infrastructure for yacht marinas and cruise terminals, as well as encourage the growth of tourism products."

Moreover, by the end of 2021, the number of new yachts registered reached 323, surging 202 percent year on year. This increase is partly due to the Overall Plan for the Construction of Hainan Free Trade Port (“the Masterplan”) that was released in June 2020, which stipulates that by 2025, there will be no tariffs on the island's import of ships for transportation, tourism, and other purposes. Import tariffs, the value-added tax, and the consumption tax will all be waived for foreign exporters – which will effectively cut prices for foreign-made products."

Azimut-Benetti, Sanlorenzo, and Ferretti Group occupy the first, second, and third place, respectively.

After defaulting in 2009, the company was bought in 2012 by SHIG–Weichai Group, a large Chinese machinery manufacturer that currently controls 75 percent of the Italian shipbuilder. Following the acquisition, the company focused on growing into new markets. It made a great impression in the Asia-Pacific region in the first quarter of 2020, selling about US$73 million and negotiating two new dealership agreements for the distribution of its yachts in Malaysia, Cambodia, and Laos.

            "Roadblocks to the development of China’s yacht market High import taxes on foreign boats are one of the primary hurdles to the development of China's yacht sector. The country has a 43.65 percent tax on boats – although recently reduced to 38.1 percent for motor yachts and 35.6 percent for sailing yachts above 8 meters. Furthermore, since the beginning of the government's Anti-Corruption Campaign in 2012, potential customers have been reluctant to flaunt their wealth, preferring to keep a low profile and avoid public scrutiny. Another considerable barrier to Chinese high-income individuals buying private boats in the Mainland, is the lack of well-equipped marinas, ship repair yards, spare parts suppliers, and all other necessary (and expensive) infrastructure for yacht upkeep and mooring. Lastly, in 2015, China strengthened its regulations for yachts travelling in its national waters, restricting the number of passengers onboard to a maximum of 12 people – which made it impossible to arrange large parties and gatherings on board since the crew alone counts six members. Furthermore, China's southern shoreline land is a particularly difficult marine zone due to ongoing territorial conflicts with neighboring states. As a result, several of the world's most prestigious shipbuilders, like Sunseeker and Ferretti Group, have shuttered their showrooms in Mainland China or eliminated the country from their core target markets, despite their Chinese ownership. Regardless, those companies continue to sell boats to Chinese customers for delivery outside of the Mainland."

            "Understanding the Chinese market and its cultural context Four purposes for boats are sailing, sports, leisure, and entertainment. For wealthy Chinese buyers, the latter would be the most common option. Given that the high-income Chinese population has little interest in sunbathing, the primary aim of these luxury boats in the contemporary setting would be to serve as a business frontier for hosting meetings, parties, and other business-related events. Yachting, however, has a bad cultural connotation as compared to other activities in a wealthy society. Also Read Hainan Free Trade Port Law: Building a Law-Based Business Environment According to market research, affluent Chinese people like golf, swimming, spas, and yoga as leisure activities, since they are well-known in Chinese culture for providing health benefits, and are thus appealing. Yachting, on the other hand, does not provide comparable physical benefits in the traditional Chinese context. Such cultural premises are fundamental when considering the gap between target customers and the industry culture. All things considered, it is not impossible for Chinese customers to shift their perspective since the country’s shopping habits and tastes are fast changing because of the ongoing rise of HNWIs. This means that tastes are subject to change and may be molded if an industry pursues them aggressively. In reality, a lack of brand familiarity and awareness provides first-mover brand opportunities."

            "The future of China’s yacht industry All in all, between financial crackdowns and setting up zones such as Hainan FTZ, what is the right space for the yacht market to develop? China's financial crackdowns continued throughout 2021, with Beijing slamming for-profit education, tanking Ant Financial and Didi IPOs, or bringing the entertainment and gaming business under control, and harnessing local digital titans. As a result, in the era of \"Common Prosperity,\" it's worth considering whether China's yacht market can take off and grow. Yet, the central government's desire to boost consumption and encourage tourism (including yacht tourism) creates unprecedented potential for the boat sector in the coming years, at least for small-to-mid-sized boats. The formation of the Hainan Free Trade Zone and the development of a new port have the potential to turn the island into a hub for China's yacht culture. The number of registered boats in Sanya has increased from 10 to 500 in the previous decade alone, and yacht rental services have grown in popularity in China, enhancing yacht culture among both the Chinese middle and high-income classes. Further, according to the jointly released by the MIIT and other ministries on August 18, 2022, there are four development goals to achieve in the yacht industry by 2025: improving the design and construction capacity, refining the foundation of the equipment industry, expanding the demands in the consumer market, and strengthening cooperation and talent cultivation. Sanya is expected to be transformed into a home port for international cruises, outlining several international first-class cruise tourism destinations. Priority is attached to the development of water tourism resources in areas such as the Circum-Bohai Sea Economic Zone, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the coastal city cluster that links Guangdong, Fujian and Zhejiang, the Hainan Free Trade Port, the Yangtze River Economic Belt, the Pearl River-West River Economic Belt, and the Grand Canal Cultural Belt. Meanwhile, Hainan is encouraged to pilot a yacht leasing business. The Guidelines also called for building teams of professional talents along the whole industry chain, covering the design, construction, operation, and management of cruises, yachts, and tourist passenger ships, as well as related tourism services and legal consulting."

The scarcity of skilled Chinese Mandarin-speaking specialists and Chinese designers, on the other hand, is stifling the growth of China's boat sector. Foreign shipbuilding businesses should tailor their offerings to the demands and preferences of Chinese boat buyers, keeping in mind lifestyle and cultural preferences. For example, Chinese yacht owners seldom spend the night on board and prefer boats with leisure and recreational amenities like KTV (karaoke) rooms. Catering to such needs, which are specific to the Chinese clientele, is an essential part of challenging cultural differences and securing a spot in such a promising market."

In the Web 2.0 age, most websites and almost all apps relied on some sort of centralized database to supply data and support their functionality. With Web 3.0, such services will employ a decentralized blockchain system rather than an arbitrary central authority. Indeed, blockchain and Web3 communities strongly support the idea of decentralized autonomous organizations (also known as DAO) as an alternative form of governance. With DAO, Web 3.0 technologies and communities will gain a type of self-governance, which will allow them to move away from centralized control over platform operations. In line with this, Web3 is also expected to function with cryptocurrencies – constructed and enabled on top of blockchain technology, allowing financial activities in the form of decentralized payments.

            "Web 3.0 applications and uses With blockchain at its core, Web3 facilitates a growing range of new apps and services. The following are projected to be among the most popular uses of future Internet networks: Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs): These are tokens that are individually unique and are kept on a blockchain with a cryptographic hash. Any sort of data, including but not limited to movies, home property records, music, autographs, and art, can be saved as an NFT. Ethereum (ETH) is now the most popular crypto blockchain for NFTs, followed by Solana (SOL). Since the information on NFT is non-fungible, no one else can duplicate it. It may be seen, shared, and traded, but not duplicated. Metaverse: The metaverse technology makes it possible for people to communicate with one other using virtual 3D avatars in an animated reality, as well as for businesses to run within the same online environment. Web3 as one of the pivotal enablers of such technology, allowing for a more immersive experience in virtual communication, content marketing, and, more broadly, digital transactions – which all cross paths with the metaverse. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is another new application, facilitated on Web 3.0 that will enable the provision of financial services beyond the bounds of traditional centralized banking infrastructure, but instead supported by decentralized blockchain technology. Cryptocurrency: In Web3, cryptocurrencies will exist as decentralized projects that perform smart contracts and automated transactions on the Internet. As discussed above, blockchain technology is fundamentally linked to the very nature of Web 3.0. Decentralized Gaming (GameFi): Decentralized Gaming, or GameFi, describes any game in which players participate in voting on the game's features and all the data is kept on a blockchain. For instance, in the , participants who successfully complete specific objectives can win AXE crypto tokens, which they can subsequently wager, or lock up for voting rights. In other words, players may use their staked AXE token to cast a vote on a variety of issues, including gaming mechanics, game visuals, content, and more. Therefore, Web3 will transform the gaming experience to become essentially consumer-centric, with an emphasis on using the game as a service rather than a standalone product. Decentralized Science (DeSc): Blockchain technology is useful also in the field of science and medicine, to store and categorize enormous volumes of data – such as , as we have seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain regions of the world have used blockchain technology to control the supply and logistics of vaccinations, specifically to prevent the spread of fake vaccines and/or the wastage of real vaccines."

            "Web3 development in China China and the United States took distinct paths as they transitioned into the Web 3.0 era. In the United States, with its open competitive environment for innovation and cutting-edge technology, the market has taken the lead as the primary (autonomous) driver of development in the field. Compared to the US, China has focused more on data exchange and industrialization in its development of Web3. Given the country's unique internet environment and the characteristics of Web 3.0-related technology, particularly blockchain, government-led projects were an inevitable choice. China's (Xinghuo BIF, 星火• 链网), for example, is among the state-owned rising stars that have gained momentum in recent years. The development of Web 3.0 in China is highly controlled by the central government and succeeding in various ways. Chinese blockchain applications are pursuing digital transactions in blockchain-based collaboration, data sharing, intelligent manufacturing, and distributed energy production emerging in areas such as medical care and government affairs. In the field of the supply chain, it is now possible to source traceability of agricultural products, industrial products, medical records, electronic invoices, and judicial evidence, among others. Finally, the pilot project for the promotion of the digital renminbi is also proceeding well. However, the realization of China's Web3 is yet to catch up to that of other countries, specifically the US. The government's rigorous control over cryptocurrencies, the absence of pertinent legal system research, and ambiguous law enforcement norms have all emerged as barriers to the development of Web3 businesses in the country. On one hand, the country outlawed the trade of cryptocurrencies, essentially outlawing the trading of NFTs on public blockchains like Ethereum. On the other, however, this move has inspired a growing number of Chinese businesses to explore new uses of blockchain technology. According to a China's blockchain market may be valued at more than US$3.2 billion by 2025, with a CAGR of 47 percent between 2020 and 2025. At present, the Web3 industry in China has begun to develop the specific types of applications as discussed below."

And yet, Chinese authorities are keen to build up the blockchain technology without allowing the decentralized financial transaction that goes with it. In other words, government support exists but is only limited to certain applications of the technology. In fact, Web 3.0 infrastructure is included in the country's upcoming major innovation priorities. Indeed, the Chinese government views blockchain dominance as crucial for strategic national development – especially since the country has struggled to stay on top of other cutting-edge technologies like semiconductors. The 14th Five-Year Plan represents China's , when President Xi Jinping mentioned it in a session of the Politburo, predicting that the technology would become critical to the next wave of innovation and economic change.

BSN is a low-key (and yet ambitious) project aimed at enabling businesses, governmental organizations, financial institutions, and others, to develop decentralized applications (dApps) on the blockchain at a reasonable cost. The platform's goal is to facilitate interoperability across various blockchains and protocols in addition to providing the necessary infrastructure and assisting in the widespread adoption of the technology. The platform is backed by state-owned enterprises like China Mobile and China UnionPay, as well as a state think tank called the State Information Center, in charge of overseeing the platform. Moreover, Tencent-owned WeBank, and Baidu are some of the big partners involved in the project. Numerous dApps, while still in the testing phase, already exist on the platform and offer multiple services that range from identity verification to smart contracts and financial solutions. Supply networks have been among the most common apps. For instance, the local administration in Yunnan (a Chinese province that is well-known for its tea) stated that it intends to utilize an app on the BSN to follow shipments of its valuable Pu'er tea.BSN is now also launching a version of its platform to be used in the international markets, although it will not allow the exchange of foreign cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum – given that the so-called open blockchains are not allowed in Mainland China. A beta version of this new blockchain, known as the BSN Spartan Network, to become operative on August 31, 2022. Legal governance In May 2022, China officially included blockchain technology into the realm of legal governance, when the Supreme People's Court issued the Opinions on Enhancing Blockchain Applications in the Judicial Area. The document provides clarification on both the broad criteria for building blockchain platforms for people's courts and the standards for judicial application of blockchain in general. Additionally, it suggests four common uses for blockchain technology: to strengthen judicial legitimacy, to increase judicial effectiveness, to strengthen judicial coordination, and to support economic and social governance."

            "Investing in China's Web3 architecture and scope for businesses With the government touting blockchain technology as a foundation for growth, the business sector is equally implementing it swiftly. Similar to the public sector, China's blockchain strategy for businesses emphasizes efficiency and disintermediation. Enterprise policy is unique in that it has a competitiveness component. Every year, the domestic private blockchain market becomes more developed. Blockdata, an industry tracker, that as of late 2018, China had 263 active blockchain initiatives, accounting for 25 percent of all active projects worldwide. This is consistent with Beijing's ambition to dominate the sector. This momentum can be observed in how swiftly Chinese businesses are embracing blockchain technology in comparison to their Western counterparts. We anticipate that as blockchain technology gains support and acclaim from Chinese leaders and governing bodies, scientific research institutes will pay it more attention and devote more resources to it. In line with , we also anticipate seeing more businesses start blockchain initiatives, and work together to the realization of a Web 3.0 environment. China will keep advancing its position as a global leader in the field, even if that means taking a different road than other countries. The Chinese blockchain industry, for example, will maintain its focus on the integration with other cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence, big data, and the Internet of Things, which will all contribute to different applications of Web 3.0. Even looking at the financial application of Web 3.0, while numerous Chinese businesses specializing in related technologies have relocated their operations overseas in recent years as a result of the government’s crackdown on cryptocurrencies, they are far from completely abandoning China. They adhere to a specific winning formula used by previous generations of IT companies: offshore incorporation, continued presence in China, and pursuit of international markets. Thus in the future, there may be space for this aspect to develop as well. After all, many of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, including Binance, FTX, KuCoin, Crypto.com, OKX, and Huobi, had their start on the Mainland. All things considered, China still accounts for one of the largest talent pools in the industry, which give it a huge advantage for the development of future information technology. The country's footprint in the technology industry and state-backed incentives for innovation and R&D also look highly attractive for foreign investors."

            "Human Genetic Resources in China: New Draft Regulation",
            "Newly released rules stand to make regulation of human genetic resources in China more stringent. Human genetic resources refer to genetic materials and data, such as organs, tissues, cells, genomes, and genes, and are used for research for biopharmaceuticals, medical devices, and other scientific purposes. On March 21, 2022, the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) released the draft (the “Rules”) for public comment. The Rules explain the implementation of human genetic resources management regulations, including general requirements, licensing requirements, record-keeping requirements, approval processes, dispute resolution processes, and enforcement, among other details. The draft Rules, in their current form, will make international involvement in China’s genetic human resources market more difficult – but not banned entirely. Accordingly, foreign businesses engaged in sectors that work with human genetic resources in China must reassess their exposure to the new regulations to maintain compliance and remain active in the market."

            "The 2019 regulations require all studies considered to be international collaborations to undertake human genetic resources compliance. Further, the regulations consider some types of human genetic resources, including whole blood, tissue biopsy, and genetic sequencing data, meaning they will be more heavily scrutinized by regulators. The regulations hold different licensing and compliance requirements depending on the type of human genetic resource activity and the nature of international collaboration or ownership. The stringent nature of human genetic resources regulations not only requires a rigorous pre-entry application and licensing process, but also ongoing reporting, audit, and internal controls to ensure compliance."

According to the Law, vocational education is equally important to general education, and consequently vocational education graduates should enjoy equal education and career opportunities. Before the new Law, middle school students could enroll in either traditional secondary schools or vocational secondary schools depending on the . As a result, students with poor grades often went to vocational secondary schools, feeding into the social perception that students should avoid such schools. Policymakers hope that these provisions will improve the social perception of vocational education, which is generally viewed as inferior to general education. Vocational education’s poor reputation in China is a contributor to talent shortages in technical vocations, as many students avoid pursuing vocational education because of social norms and expectations. In addition to elevating the status of vocational education, the Law contains other measures to improve the quality of China’s vocational education system. The Law states that China should have a modern vocational education system basically in place by 2025, with improved conditions and quality. By 2035, China should have a world-leading vocational education system, and the social status of technical and skilled workers should be greatly improved. The Law also contains multiple provisions encouraging international cooperation, including to establish Sino-foreign cooperative education projects and expand exchange platforms. These provisions also encourage Chinese vocational education schools to go abroad alongside the globalization of Chinese companies."

Earlier, in May 2021, the government released regulations that strengthened Communist Party control over the education system and further limited the use of foreign teaching materials. Reforms have also affected the vocational education, but to further promote the industry’s development. In October 2021, the Communist Party Central Committee and the State Council released the guidelines set the stage for the Law, stipulating that enrollment in vocational institutions should be at least 10 percent of the total enrollment of higher education institutions by 2025, and China’s vocational education should be among the best in the world by 2035.

China already has the vocational education system, featuring some 11,300 schools enrolling a total of 30.88 million students and 10 million graduates per year. Reforms to vocational education, however, do not just seek to expand the size of vocational education, but more importantly improve the quality. Vocational education schools in China have historically been embroiled in numerous scandals, contributing to their negative social perception. For example, some vocational education schools in China have offered to attract students hoping to enter new careers. Other companies have been accused of exploiting workers by making deals with vocational education schools to recruit student “interns” paid at below minimum wage. The in this vein occurred in 2010, when the electronics manufacturer Foxconn employed over 150,000 “interns” from vocational schools at below minimum wage. The perceived low quality of vocational education in China presents opportunities for foreign investors to position themselves in the market as providers of high-quality, reputable education. Additionally, foreign vocational education providers can establish industry connections to ensure their education is relevant, practical, and leads to immediate employment opportunities. Ultimately, the earning potential of graduates is one of the strongest indicators of vocational education quality. In 2019, the of people with undergraduate degrees in China was RMB 5,440 (US$823) per month, compared to RMB 4,295 (US$650) for people with vocational education degrees.

Nevertheless, China’s current policies supporting the development of vocational education present a favorable environment for foreign investment. To minimize regulatory and legal risks and ensure long-term success in the industry, foreign investors should conduct significant pre-investment due diligence, ongoing monitoring of the policy environment, and contingency planning to prepare for different scenarios."

However, many companies are also choosing to remain within the country and instead relocating their factories to lower-cost locations in China's growing central and western provinces. This shift in manufacturing locations is driven by a combination of factors, including lower production costs, improved manufacturing capacity, and better integration with supply chains when compared to offshore alternatives.

Between 2014 and 2022, the total annual exports of China’s western provinces (Chongqing, Gansu, Guangxi, Guizhou, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Tibet, Xinjiang, and Yunnan) grew from RMB 1.34 trillion (US$217.5 billion) to RMB 2.34 trillion (US$319.8 billion), a CAGR of 7.25 percent. The central regions, though making up fewer provinces overall (Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Shanxi), have grown even faster, increasing from RMB 974.2 billion in 2014 to RMB 2.57 trillion in 2022.

While past decades saw a huge exodus of workers from central and western regions to the eastern manufacturing powerhouses, this phenomenon has gradually reversed. The latest data from China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on the movement of migrant workers (generally, people who leave rural areas to find work in urban areas), suggests that people are increasingly looking for work nearer to home. Of the 295.62 million migrant workers recorded in 2022, 58.9 percent chose to stay within their own province, a slight increase from 2021, while 41.1 percent traveled outside their province to find work. Moreover, the number of migrant workers traveling to the central and western regions has increased faster than the number traveling to the east. In 2022, the number of migrant workers employed in the eastern provinces increased by just 0.1 percent year-on-year, while the number employed in the central provinces increased by 3 percent year-on-year. In western provinces, the number increased by 2.5 percent year-on-year.

            "Inland China’s pull factors for foreign companies China’s inland regions offer a range of benefits that are attractive to foreign companies seeking lower-cost alternatives to the traditional manufacturing hubs on the coast. These factors differ depending on the industry sector. While labor-intensive and cost-sensitive sectors may primarily be attracted by lower wages and cheaper floorspace, energy-intensive sectors are also considering the availability of cheaper energy sources, in particular renewables. Minimum wages in China have risen considerably over the past few decades, with the coastal cities seeing the highest minimums in the country. At the time of writing in 2023, all provinces and municipalities with a regional minimum wage of RMB 2,200 (US$300.65) or above were in eastern China. The province with the lowest monthly minimum wage in 2023 was Gansu, at RMB 1,820 (US$248.72) per month. Meanwhile, salaries in the private sector have increased from an average of RMB 32,706 (US$5,318) per year in 2013 to RMB 65,237 (US$8,915) per year in 2022. Average annual salaries differ considerably across the country, however, with a large gap between the richer eastern provinces and the central and western provinces. While the average annual private sector salary in Guangdong province in 2022 was RMB 77,657 (US$10,613), in Henan it was just RMB 47,918 (US$6,548.5), while in Guangxi it was RMB 49,951 (US$6,826). China’s changing internal migration patterns and shifting demographics may also serve to accelerate the rise in wages in eastern provinces. A combination of low birth rates and an aging population with less internal migration is likely to exacerbate labor shortages in more expensive eastern provinces, further driving upward pressure on wages. Another factor driving up the cost of manufacturing in China is the rising prices of industrial land. Although the cost of land for industrial use remains considerably lower than land for residential use, prices in eastern coastal cities have nonetheless become more unaffordable, in particular for smaller and cost-sensitive businesses. Coastal cities such as Ningbo, Zhejiang, and Shanghai have some of the highest cost per square meter of industrial land in the country, whereas even larger cities inland are considerably cheaper. As of September 2021, the latest data available, the average cost of industrial land in Shanghai was RMB 1,975 (US$269.9) per square meter, and Ningbo was RMB 1,287 (US$175.9) per square meter. In Nanchang, the provincial capital of Jiangxi, the price was RMB 405 (US$55.4) per square meter, while in Chongqing municipality it was RMB 480 (US$65.6) per square meter. For energy-intensive manufacturing, a major draw to China’s inland provinces is the availability and proximity of cheaper energy resources, and in particular renewables. The remote and sparsely-populated western provinces, in particular, have ample access to land and renewables in the form of wind, solar, and hydroelectric power. It is also worth noting that the overwhelming strength of China’s supply chains also plays a part in the attractiveness of inland provinces over neighboring countries when it comes to the question of reshoring. Although moving manufacturing to inland China adds to the time and cost of shipping, these provinces are also much closer to the source of raw materials and are more deeply integrated into existing supply chains, compared to industries in Southeast Asia and other reshoring destinations."

These opinions also mention the strategy of “gradient transfer” (梯度转移), specifically in the field of the development of processing trade. In early 2022, a group of government departments issued a set of opinions on “promoting the orderly transfer of manufacturing industries”, proposing measures for ensuring central, western, and northeastern provinces have the capability to undertake this transfer. These opinions particularly promote the shift of labor-intensive industries to \"areas with abundant labor and convenient transportation in the central and western regions”. Moreover, they seek to promote the transfer of technology-intensive industries to areas “rich in innovation factors and solid industrial foundations” in central, western, and northeastern regions."

            "Encouraging foreign investment in inland China Over the years, the government has issued several policy documents and implemented various incentive programs to attract foreign investment in inland China. A 2017 outlining several measures to expand foreign investment called for, among other proposals, supporting the “central, western, and northeastern regions to undertake the transfer of foreign-invested industries”. The measures proposed in the Circular include providing FIEs relocating to central, western, and northeastern China with preferential capital and land policies, as well as other state support for industrial transfer and processing trade. Since 2001, China’s tax authorities have also provided a reduced 15 percent corporate income tax (CIT) rate for companies operating in certain eligible industries in western provinces. This policy, which has been extended twice in 2010 and , applies to both foreign and domestic companies working in certain encouraged industries in the western provinces, as well as certain areas of central and northeastern provinces (Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefectures in Hunan, Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefectures in Hubei, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin, and Ganzhou City in Jiangxi). The eligible industries are different for foreign and domestic companies. Key points to note are: For foreign companies, they include all industry sectors listed in the Catalog of Encouraged Industries for Foreign Investment (2022 Edition), while for domestic companies, they include the encouraged sectors listed in the and the . Industry sectors in the latter catalog differ from province to province and are updated periodically, but generally include high-end technology sectors, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and international trade. While the reduced 15 percent CIT rate is also available in other areas of China, its implementation in western provinces is notable as it is applicable to companies operating in any area of a province, and is not limited to certain development and industrial zones as is the case in eastern China. This policy is currently in place until the end of 2030."

            "Improving infrastructure and resource provision in inland China Working in tandem with the above policies are efforts to upgrade the region's infrastructure and technological capabilities, thereby making it a more attractive destination for foreign investment. In recent years, China’s central and regional governments have proposed development projects and released policy documents, seeking to leverage existing advantages in the western and central provinces to build up local capacity and infrastructure for production industries. For example, the “”, “”, and more recently, the “Eastern Data, Western Computing” project. The data project will see the construction of multiple “computing hubs” in China’s western and central regions, which will process and store the massive amounts of data produced by industries in eastern China. It is hoped that this will increase the demand for computing services in western China while simultaneously reducing the pressure on data centers in the coastal provinces. China’s western provinces have also been actively establishing new development and industrial zones, thereby enabling them to host the influx of production companies. Since 2019, free trade zones (FTZs) have been established in the provinces of Yunnan, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Anhui, Henan, and Hubei. In October 2023, the State Council also the establishment of an FTZ in Xinjiang."

            "Considerations for foreign companies Deciding on whether to move manufacturing to inland China will largely depend on the underlying reason for moving production out of eastern China. For companies operating in labor-intensive industries and cost-sensitive industries, the ideal location for a new factory may be a lower-tier urban area in central China or the nearer western provinces. Meanwhile, a company engaged in energy-intensive production may seek a lower-density area with better natural resources. In addition, considerations may also be given to factors such as the industry sector and the technological capabilities, infrastructure, and talent pools available in individual cities, industrial parks, and development zones. The decision to move production to inland China will require in-depth research into the advantages and disadvantages of various locations. Considerations will include a vast range of factors, including the availability of land, labor, raw materials, and other resources, regional operating costs, local support policies, and much more. Location analysis becomes even more complex when looking at multiple countries as possible destinations, as knowledge of local industry regulations and other compliance considerations will be required in addition to an understanding of the local operating conditions. Our advisors at Dezan Shira & Associates can provide location and site analysis, cross-country competitiveness benchmarking, and supply chain reengineering solutions to help businesses make intelligent decisions on where to relocate their investments.

Starbucks is partnering with the plant-based meat companies Beyond Meat and Omnipork to offer more vegetarian-friendly food options, such as lasagne imitating the taste and texture of beef. KFC, meanwhile, is also collaborating with the US agribusiness company Cargill to introduce a limited run of plant-based fried chicken in select locations in China. The new products on offer by Starbucks and KFC represent the latest effort by both food and beverage companies and plant-based meat producers to test the Chinese market’s interest in new types of meat substitutes. The industry is still relatively young worldwide, and especially so in China. In this article, we look at the state of the plant-based meat industry in the country and offer considerations for food and beverage operators and producers looking to enter the market."

            "Why plant-based meat? The concept of imitation meat is not new – especially to China. In the West, meat analogue products like Tofurkey – a tofu-based imitation of turkey meat – have been on the market for decades. In China, vegetable-based imitations of meat products have existed since , when Chinese Buddhists created vegetarian versions of traditional dishes. What makes the new generation of plant-based meat different from previous iterations is its use of technology to engineer tastes and textures that so closely resemble meat that it can be difficult to tell the difference. Beyond Meat, one of the leading companies in the field, uses pea protein as its engineering base, while Impossible Foods – another industry leader – uses a soy base. Some companies, like JUST Meat, develop meat in cultures from animal cells, though these are not the same as plant-based meats and have not yet been released for mass consumption."

            "Because plant-based meat so closely resembles real meat, producers hope to not only reach vegetarian and vegan consumers, but also meat eaters. To do so, producers use ethical arguments that their plant-based meat is healthier and better for the environment than real meat. Beyond Meat, for example, advertises than their burger uses 99 percent less water, 93 percent less land, and 90 percent less fossil fuel emissions than a quarter pound of beef. While in practice the health and climate benefits of plant-based meat is still , further advancements in the industry have the potential to meet these aspirations. The COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak has also highlighted some of the potential safety benefits of a pivot towards plant-based meat, including in China. Over 90 percent of the world’s meat comes from factory farms, where animals are held to close proximity to one another in what can be unsanitary conditions, which . Most experts believe that COVID-19 originated from animal to human transition in a Chinese wet market, similar to how the SARS outbreak began in 2003. Though it did not affect humans, China is also with an outbreak of African swine fever that emerged in 2018 and subsequently decimated the country’s pork supplies, requiring the culling of over a million pigs. In addition to other ethical considerations, less reliance on the method of factory farming could potentially mitigate conditions that trigger zoonotic disease outbreaks besides providing governments with an alternative source of food in plant-based alternatives."

            "How does China’s plant-based meat market compare? Compared to North America, where companies like Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods have become market leaders, the Chinese market is more fractured. Beyond Meat’s partnership with Starbucks, for example, is the company’s first foray in mainland China. Domestic Chinese startups like Zhenmeat and Starfield have emerged in recent years, offering similar style plant-based meat substitute products, with the former’s products based off string beans and pea protein and the latter’s based off bean protein. However, their food technology is still considered less advanced than their US competitors. One area where homegrown companies may have an advantage, though, is in offering alternative meat products suited to Chinese dishes and satisfy the local palate. Besides offering products like burger patties and hotdogs, Chinese companies are developing plant-based alternatives for popular Chinese dishes, such as meatballs used in hotpot. Zhenmeat is even experimenting with 3D printed bones to imitate the experience of eating meat off the bone."

            "While Chinese consumers have had little exposure to new plant-based meat products, there are signs that the market could be receptive. For one, the Chinese government has an ambitious goal to halve meat consumption by 2030 in a bid to slash emissions and tackle obesity. If the government is to achieve its goals, it will need to take dramatic measures to reverse current trends. China is already the world’s largest meat consumer – responsible for 27 percent of the world’s total – and though it lags behind developed countries in per capita meat consumption, this continues to grow. As such, the meat alternatives industry may benefit from supportive measures to allow the government to meet its targets, including by offering incentives and cutting restrictions. Moreover, Chinese consumers are now more open to the idea of plant-based meat products. China represents 53 percent of the world’s meat substitutes industry already, compared to just 5.5 percent for the US, though this segment is dominated by traditional meat substitutes. Further, according to research conducted by the academic journal Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems, close to 96 percent of respondents in China say they are “somewhat” or “extremely” likely to purchase plant-based meat, compared to about 75 percent of American respondents. Many Chinese consumers are actively seeking to reduce their meat consumption. A 2018 report from the New Zealand Institute for Plant & Food Research, for example, found that 39 percent of Chinese consumers are reducing their meat consumption, opting instead for more vegetables, tofu, and vegan meat substitutes. Already, China has , who offer an immediate consumer base that do not need to be convinced to experiment with meat alternatives. Young urban Chinese consumers in particular have expressed openness to plant-based meat, seeing such products as contributing to a healthy lifestyle. According to , over 80 percent of consumers who had eaten plant-based meat within a six-month span were born after 1990. If plant-based meat products gain traction in China, the prospects are lucrative. According to the market research firm CB Insights, protein consumption in China is growing at a rate of 3 to 4 percent per year. By 2025, China is projected to account for 35 percent of all protein consumption. If plant-based meat products make just a small dent in China’s total protein consumption, the size of the market will translate into significant returns."

As such, the two parties need to agree on the product’s quality and presentation, as well as the rights to the recipe.

KFC is the best example of a fried chicken specialist that understood how to capture Chinese tastes while maintaining its American brand identity. Fast-food restaurants in China offer pork chops, curry, and Chinese staples like congee and youtiao. In this respect, KFC demonstrates exceptional cross-cultural adaptation in China. Indeed, while McDonald's was able to achieve success in China relatively quickly, nowadays it does lag behind KFC in terms of both market share and overall presence in the country."

In the field of solar battery modules, Chinese companies hold around 71 percent global market share. The country’s booming new energy vehicle (NEV) industry and decarbonization-driven solar industry are contributing to China’s insatiable appetite for batteries. However, despite China’s dominant position in manufacturing, the country remains reliant on imports for key materials and components for their production, which makes the industry vulnerable to price fluctuations and supply chain crunches. In addition, issues within the domestic industry, such as lopsided supply chain development, an imbalance in supply and demand, local protectionism, and quality inconsistencies are hampering the healthy growth of the industry. These inefficiencies are likely to exacerbate battery supply shortages for industries such as NEVs and solar, which may in turn slow the growth of these industries."

            "China has a wealth of natural resources, including many of the raw materials needed for the production of li-ion batteries, such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel. However, in many cases, China’s strength in these industries lies not in the number of resources and scale of extraction, but in its processing and refining capabilities. China held only around 7.9 percent of the world’s lithium reserves at the end of 2020, according to BP’s. However, the country is estimated to have 60 percent of the world’s capacity for processing and refining. For this reason - and the extremely high demand for batteries - China is still reliant on imports for many of these materials. China’s main sources of lithium carbonate are countries such as Australia, Chile, and Argentina. Reliance on imports makes China’s battery industry vulnerable to price fluctuations of raw materials, and due to the high demand and production shortfall, prices of certain materials are sky-high. The price of battery-grade lithium carbonate, one of the core ingredients for making li-ion batteries, reached a record high of RMB 597,500 (US$89,019) per ton on November 11, a provider of steel information services. The at the time of writing this article (November 28) was RMB 580,676 (US$86,513) per ton, a year-on-year growth rate of 201.08 percent."

On August 24, 2022, the MIIT, along with SAMR and the National Energy Administration (NEA) issued calling for the coordinated development of the photovoltaic industry supply chain. This shows the government is keen to address shortcomings within domestic supply chains. However, there are other factors that may help to cool the battery market besides direct government intervention in the industry. One is a decrease in demand for batteries from other industries, such as solar and NEVs. For instance, continued increases in the cost of NEVs may in turn reduce demand, and thereby demand for lithium. In the longer term, a reduction in the Chinese government’s NEV subsidies would further cool demand for car batteries. In addition to the proposals mentioned in this notice, China is and will continue to make efforts to increase the extraction of key minerals, both in China and abroad, in order to meet domestic demand. A combination of increasing the supply of key minerals and keeping demand reasonable will be key for stabilizing the market and ensuring sustainable industry growth."

            "China's older generation has undergone a noticeable transformation in recent years, displaying a departure from their traditional reputation for frugality and home-centered lifestyles focused on grandchild care. Instead, the 'new' older generation now possesses both financial resources and leisure time, demonstrating a more adventurous and resourceful approach to enjoying their golden years. This shift can be attributed to a heightened emphasis on health consciousness and a desire to maintain a youthful appearance. Older individuals are actively investing in healthy foods and supplements, with health supplements ranking high on the wish lists of Chinese tourists and being popular gifts among older people in China. Additionally, both men and women in this generation seek to appear younger by dyeing their hair and availing themselves of beauty treatments. In addition to these aesthetic procedures, this cohort is also purchasing more cosmetics and jewelry, benefiting both domestic and foreign luxury brands. Further, the increased wealth of the older generation has stimulated growth in wealth management, financial planning, and insurance sectors. With greater savings and disposable income, this generation has a greater demand for services that safeguard their financial well-being in retirement and facilitate the transfer of wealth to future generations. Elderly individuals' preferences regarding retirement have undergone noticeable changes, as more of them are now choosing to spend their later years in senior homes instead of relying on their children for care. This shift is primarily driven by the desire for a comfortable and hassle-free lifestyle. These homes cater to their needs and provide a high standard of living. They are often constructed by real estate companies, specifically designed for older consumers, and offer a range of amenities and services tailored to their preferences. Additionally, to meet the demand for upscale senior facilities, some former upscale hotels in suburban areas have been transformed into luxury senior homes, providing a sophisticated and elegant environment for retirees to enjoy their golden years."

            "The main consumption patterns of China's elderly population can be grouped into two categories: daily consumption (39.1 percent) and health-related consumption (40.9 percent). The senior population faces more health issues, and as a result, health consumption has become their primary focus. When it comes to health consumption, the silver-haired population is not only concerned about healthcare but also increasingly emphasizes disease prevention. Especially due to the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, health awareness has become increasingly popular among people at large. In relation to this, preventive health services, such as physical examinations, will have significant room for growth. Industry data reveals that over 80 percent of China's elderly population with a monthly disposable income exceeding RMB 15,000 (US$2,067), are more likely to have regular health checkups for longer periods of time (over five years), and likewise, 40 percent of those living in top-tiers cities exhibit the same patterns. It is evident that regular physical examinations require a certain amount of time, economic costs, and medical support. Therefore, the high-income population in first- and second-tier cities can sustain regular physical examinations for a longer period of time due to their subjective willingness and objective conditions."

            "Maturation of tourism in China The rise of camping signals a longer-term maturation of the tourism industry. Organized tour groups that shuttle tourists between scenic spots are becoming increasingly passé, especially among younger consumers who prefer the flexibility and freedom offered by independent or customized travel. Many experienced travelers who have already ticked major domestic cities and tourist destinations off their bucket lists are now looking for something different and more adventurous. Younger generations who grew up in wealthy families will also have experienced going on family holidays when they were young - something that was not accessible to many older generations - and therefore are more comfortable with newer forms of leisure and travel. China has a wealth of natural scenery and a diverse range of environments, much of which has only recently begun to be explored (for the purpose of leisure) by intrepid travelers. Camping in China, as in many other parts of the world, is closely associated with other outdoor pastimes, such as hiking and self-driving tours (called 自驾游 in Chinese). The camping trend therefore has the potential to pique interest in a wider range of outdoor activities, such as hiking, climbing, and fishing, as well as road trips and cycling tours."

            "COVID-19 driving increase in short-haul trips and staycations The pandemic has played a significant role in driving the more recent surge in camping activity. With frequently changing and unpredictable local travel restrictions becoming the norm, many people opt to stay closer to home, as evidenced by the increase in popularity of city breaks, staycations, and short-haul trips. According to data from Chinese travel platform Ctrip, more than 70 percent of bookings for scenic spots in the last year came from nearby areas, and more than 80 percent of bookings for products, such as hotels, tickets, and entertainment, were made one to two days prior to the trip. Short-haul trips also surged during the 2022 Dragonboat Festival in June and the Labor Day holiday at the start of May. According to Ctrip, over 50 percent of the bookings made in the run-up to the holiday were for destinations within the same province as where the user was located, while bookings for short-haul trips grew 20 percent in the run-up to the Dragonboat Festival holiday. This phenomenon has also meant that travel is not limited to holiday periods and long weekends. Last-minute weekend city breaks are becoming increasingly popular, which is good news for travel companies seeking to capitalize on more consumption opportunities. This short-haul trend is set to continue as China adopts a “normalized” approach to COVID-19 containment, which involves frequent COVID-19 testing, snap short-term lockdowns, and increased testing requirements for interprovincial travel. Camping is well-suited to short-haul and weekend trips due to the vicinity of green spaces and camping grounds to most cities. Rural and suburban areas are accessible even from sprawling metropolises like Shanghai and the surrounding Yangtze River Delta (YRD) area, and many have large green spaces within the metropolitan areas as well."

            "Rural revitalization and promotion of outdoor activities The central government is keen to encourage the development of outdoor activities as part of its “rural revitalization” strategy, as well as its policies on promoting better fitness and exercise. Rural revitalization is a policy that seeks to develop impoverished rural areas and balance the rural-urban economic divide. Developing rural tourism and activities is seen as one way in which to create more opportunities for rural populations that are otherwise limited in the scope of work available. Government agencies have released several policy documents on developing outdoor activity. One such document is the (“14th FYP”), which seeks to promote sports and fitness activities by improving infrastructure, services, and awareness among the population. Although it doesn’t specifically mention camping, except with regard to establishing conferences for showcasing recreational vehicles (RVs), it does actively seek to develop several adjacent industries and expand China’s outdoor recreational economy. The 14th FYP dedicates a section to the development of outdoor activity, including winter sports, mountain sports, water sports, driving and motorcycling, air sports, cycling, marathons, and triathlons. In March 2022, the National Rural Revitalization Administration (NRRA), a government agency under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA), released a set of opinions on developing public fitness services. The opinions call for: Carrying out pilot projects for opening up natural resources to outdoor sports, and formulating a catalogue of outdoor sports activities that are allowed in available waters, airspace, forests, grasslands, and other natural areas. Encouraging outdoor sports equipment manufacturing companies to extend their development to the service industry. Building ice, snow, and mountain sports fields, mountain climbing and hiking trails, cycling trails, and other facilities. Improving outdoor sports infrastructure and service capabilities, such as parking, power and water supply, sanitation, communication, signage, and emergency rescue, as well as facilities such as showers, changing rooms, and storage. In response to the policies, travel companies, such as and Alibaba-owned , have launched their own rural revitalization programs, often in collaboration with large hotel brands, which increase investment in rural tourism by assisting local businesses with online operations, training, and brand building."

            "“Glamping” and luxury nature breaks “Glamping”, a portmanteau of “glamourous” and “camping” has become a hugely popular choice for weary office workers seeking a more up-market and comfortable nature break than that offered by bare-bones traditional camping. Many glamping campgrounds are situated in suburban green spaces and parks, making them ideal for a weekend getaway or short holiday. However, offerings for luxury rural retreats in more far-flung regions also exist for those seeking a longer stay. Many glamping grounds and operators offer full packages, including luxury tents, meals, and entertainment, so that guests aren’t required to know how to set up a tent or light a barbeque in order to enjoy a camping experience. Higher-end luxury tents, which focus on comfort and aesthetics and can cost between RMB 3,000 and 4,000 (US$444 to US$592) are becoming increasingly popular, as well as accompanying products, such as portable coffee machines, barbeques, lighting, foldable camping furniture, and so on. For foreign investors, the shifts in Chinese travel habits present a range of new sectors to tap into as consumers seek new outdoor adventures and customized experiences. Glamping, and indeed ordinary camping, is also not confined to overnight stays. Setting up tents in local parks to enjoy a daytime picnic is a popular pastime during the warmer months, offering more opportunities for sellers of outdoor equipment, such as tents and picnic gear."

            "Outdoor sports equipment and supplies The outdoor sports and activity sector has been growing rapidly over the past decade as more people head to the great outdoors on their time off. Recent years have seen growth stabilize somewhat, perhaps due to the fact that many types of outdoor equipment are made to be durable and are used infrequently, translating to rarer repeat purchases. However, the sector still has considerable potential for further growth as income and living standards continue to rise and more emphasis is placed on health and well-being. Compared to developed markets, China's consumption of outdoor products remains relatively low, but with the current explosion in popularity of camping, we are likely to see a new cohort of consumers emerge. In addition, research shows that consumers are willing to spend more money on camping equipment specifically. According to a survey by , consumers had on average spent RMB 6,995 (US$1035) on camping equipment in the past. Among them, 26.5 percent had previously spent under RMB 3,000 (US$444) on camping equipment, whereas 25.9 percent spent between RMB 3,000 and RMB 5,000 (US$740) in the past year and 47.6 percent spent over RMB 5,000 in the past year. According to e-commerce giant JD.com, searches for camping products surged 145 percent year-on-year between April and mid-May 2022, while the turnover for rescue equipment, tent mats, extreme outdoor activity supplies, and picnic supplies grew 256 percent, 229 percent, 165 percent, and 165 percent respectively. Major companies operating in the outdoor sports equipment space include Nordisk, Snow Peak, and Kolon Sport in the high-end market and Decathlon, Mobi Garden, and Kailas in the mid-range market."

            "Recreational vehicles The RV market in China remains relatively small compared to that in developed regions, such as the US and Europe, but nonetheless is a sector worthy of attention. According to data from market research firm Intelligence Research Group, the Chinese RV market grew from RMB 2.2 billion (US$325.9 million) in 2014 to RMB 20.8 billion (US$3.1 billion) in 2020, a compound annual growth rate of 45.48 percent. The number of RVs in ownership has also increased more than 10-fold during this period, reaching 218,204 vehicles in 2020. There is also considerable growth potential for the sector. According to Intelligence Research Group, RV ownership per 1,000 people in the US and Europe stood at 30 and 15 vehicles, respectively, whereas in China it is only 0.2. The areas with the highest sales of RVs were Jiangsu, Shandong, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Beijing. The number of RVs approved for market by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has also continued to rise every year, with 428 new models applying for registration in 2020.

            "Outdoor sports and travel Camping is, naturally, closely associated with other outdoor sports and activities, and its rise in popularity has happened in tandem with the spread of activities such as hiking, cycling, trail running, fishing, and climbing, as well as the so-called self-driving travel. The rise in camping presents opportunities for travel companies to offer a range of activities in combination with camping, such as custom-made outdoor tours. Such tours are becoming increasingly popular for company outings and team-building trips, in addition to vacation plans among families and friend groups. These types of tours are particularly attractive to newer and more inexperienced travelers who are not yet as familiar with outdoor activity. The car rental market has also seen significant growth over the past decade as the popularity of road trips has taken off. The car rental market reached a valuation of around RMB 100 billion (US$14.8 billion) in 2020 and is forecast to reach RMB 160 billion (US$23.7 billion) by 2025, according to Intelligence Research Group."

            "Investing in the future of China travel The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the travel industry, and with strict quarantine requirements for inbound travelers to China, international travel for the vast majority of Chinese consumers has been out of the picture. However, China’s travel industry has been able to recover significantly due to the sheer size of the domestic consumer base, who have been keenly rediscovering the country and its natural scenery in the years since the pandemic broke out. It is against this backdrop that the popularity of camping has risen. The camping trend also evidences the resilience and flexibility of China’s travel industry, as well as the types of new opportunities that can arise even under significant limitations. With its focus on short trips to nearby areas, camping is also shielded from a future in which international travel becomes possible again for Chinese travelers, as many camping trips are made on weekends and short holidays. At the same time, the rise of camping over the past couple of years signals a longer-term shift in the way Chinese people like to travel - nature-focused, customized, and with an emphasis on lifestyle and well-being. Many consumers will have only recently had their first camping experience and will be eager to head to the outdoors again. For investors, this presents a range of new sectors to tap into that go beyond just camping, as consumers look to new outdoor adventures and experiences."

From October 2015, it has become mandatory for exporters to register each shipment of food products online with the Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) for tracking purposes. Additionally, with the aim of enhancing oversight of imported food facilities, China's General Administration of Customs (GACC) introduced the Administrative Provisions on Registration of Overseas Manufacturers of Imported Food, referred to as \"Decree 248,\" on April 21, 2021. This regulation became effective from January 1, 2022, imposing that all imported food items destined for China, with final production concluded on or after that date, must display GACC-issued registration numbers on both their inner and outer packaging. In general, GACC registration is necessary for both imported food items and foreign exporters of such products. This registration process is documented within the China Single Window digital platform, commonly referred to as CIFER. The specific registration form to complete is contingent upon the kind of food one intends to export to China. This distinction is grounded in the regulations that classify foods into two categories: those that require recommendation and those that necessitate registration."

In total, there are 154 provisions within the law. Its primary objective is to guarantee the safety of food and protect the overall well-being and survival of the general populace. This comprehensive legislation encompasses the establishment of a licensing system to regulate food-related activities, ensuring that individuals engaged in food production, sales, and catering services acquire proper permits. The FSL also emphasizes the proper storage and handling of food, mandating compliance with food safety regulations, regular inventory checks, and the swift removal of expired or deteriorated items. An integral component of the law is the implementation of a robust food recall system, requiring food producers to take immediate action if their products are deemed unsafe—including recalling items from the market and notifying relevant stakeholders. Furthermore, the legislation places a significant emphasis on the safety of imported and exported food, assigning oversight responsibilities to the SAMR. This highlights the law's dedication to safeguarding public health by ensuring that imported products meet China’s rigorous food safety standards and labeling requirements."

            "A huge proportion of personal assets are tied up in the property sector in China - as much as of household wealth is in property. The constant rise in house prices also means that property has over the years increasingly come to be seen as a lucrative investment. This is compounded by the fact that China currently doesn’t have a property tax (more on this later), which further facilitates more families and individuals to buy second or even third homes in the expectation that prices will continue to rise. This has happened in tandem with a rise in property presales, wherein a property developer sells a home to an individual or investor that does not yet exist. This is where the intersection between finance and the property market becomes particularly strong, and where the beginning of China’s property woes can be seen."

            "Property developers are some of the largest companies in China. These companies made huge profits off the back of the property boom that China has seen over the past two decades. According to data from the NBS, total sales of commercial housing grew from RMB 5.8 trillion (US$914 billion) in 2011 to RMB 17.3 trillion (US$2.7 trillion) in 2020, a 21.8 percent annual growth rate. Residential housing makes up the lion’s share of the new builds by property developers. Combined, property developers built 16.4 trillion square meters of new residential housing in 2020, accounting for approximately 73 percent of total new builds. The largest source of income for property developers in 2020 (the latest available data) were deposits and presales, indicating a huge reliance on so-called ‘speculative’ spending from individuals and enterprises. That year, property developers raised over RMB 6.6 trillion (US$1 trillion) from these two sources alone. Property developers are also highly reliant on credit to enable the liquidity needed for their projects. In 2020, the property development sector took out a total of RMB 2.6 trillion (US$419 billion) in domestic loans."

            "To fully understand China’s property market, we must also understand the relationship it has with the government, and local governments, in particular. In China, the government owns the rights to all land in cities. Companies and individuals can purchase land-use rights from the government for a period of up to 70 years, after which time the lease can be extended. The property built upon the leased land can be bought and owned by companies and individuals. Land sales are therefore a major source of income for the government, especially local governments. This reliance on land sales is compounded by the fact that local governments are responsible for spending on public infrastructure in their jurisdictions as a means of stimulating the economy and ensuring jobs. In addition, local governments had been prohibited from raising money through bond sales until 2015. For this reason, land sales have been a major lifeline for local governments. It is estimated that revenue from land transfers and real estate special tax together accounted for 37.6 percent of local governments’ fiscal revenue in 2020. And just as local governments rely on real estate developers to lease land to raise funds, so property developers rely on local governments to fund development. As mentioned, local governments are responsible for a large proportion of infrastructure spending in their jurisdictions, which means they are frequently the main contractors for the developers, and by extension, construction companies."

This is where the use of local government financing vehicles (LGFVs) comes in. LGFVs are investment companies that are owned by local governments. They were created as means to bypass a ban on direct borrowing by governments. The LGFV can take out loans on behalf of the government to finance infrastructure or welfare projects. In addition to bypassing the ban on direct borrowing, debt accrued by LGFVs is also not added to the official balance sheet, which in turn has allowed governments to borrow far beyond the permitted debt limits. This is what has been dubbed ‘hidden debt’ by the central government and has become a thorn in the side of the government and a crucial issue to be resolved."

In attendance in the meeting were 12 of China’s largest property developers - and were asked to take action to reduce debt. The outcome of the meeting was a policy known as the \"three red lines\". This policy (which has not been made public) requires that property developers must meet certain criteria before they can apply for refinancing. The three red lines for real estate companies are: An asset-liability ratio (after excluding advance receipts) of no greater than 70 percent A net debt ratio of no more than 100 percent A cash to short-term debt ratio of one or below At the time of the meeting, all the developers present at the meeting crossed at least one of the red lines.

Now the liquidity crunch in the property sector is being felt by local governments, who are already facing a mounting debt crisis of their own. Data from the NBS shows that the area of real estate land acquisition decreased by 11.2 percent in November 2021 (latest available data). A research report from Tianfeng Securities, a securities consulting firm, also shows that most provincial governments experienced an overall drop in land transfers from the previous year. According to the report, 13 provinces and autonomous regions saw a fall in transfer fees of more than 20 percent year-on-year in 2021. Among them, seven provinces achieved less than 60 percent of their annual land transfer target, with Yunnan province experiencing the lowest rate at just 19 percent. This has put even more pressure on local governments, who are also being asked to increase spending to stimulate the slowing economy and fuel recovery. Fewer funds coming from land sales may mean that governments will rely more heavily on LGFVs, which could further exacerbate the hidden debt issue that Beijing is keen to eliminate."

One method has been to relax the three red lines policy to give developers more leeway to refinance their loans. Chinese media outlet Calianshe reported on January 6, 2022, that several large property developers had received notice from the government that it plans to exclude merger and acquisitions loans from the calculation of property developers’ debt and allow them to increase their debt level by five percent. This will make it significantly easier for companies with better liquidity to buy assets from indebted developers and help ease the pressure. Although this may help to inject some liquidity into the sector, it is likely not enough to completely reverse the course for the sector as a whole. In general, it appears that the central government will not budge from its bottom line and is determined to get the market to address debt, which will mean continued pressure on property companies."

As discussed above, local governments were historically prohibited from direct borrowing (such as by participating in the bond market), leading to the rise of LGFVs. However, in 2015, recognizing local governments’ need for another cash stream and in an effort to wean them off of LGFVs, the central government began allowing local governments to issue SPBs. Through this scheme, local governments were also able to transfer some of their debt from the LGFVs to SPBs. In late 2021, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) released RMB 1.46 trillion (US$230 billion) of the 2022 quota for SPBs in order to inject more liquidity and stimulate infrastructure spending. The funds raised are meant to be spent in the first quarter of 2022 to boost the slowing economy."

In addition, funds raised from SPBs have at times been misappropriated and spent on projects outside the permitted scope.

            "A potential solution to the ‘speculative’ spending on homes is the introduction of a property tax, expanding it to cover tax on real estate for residential use. In August 2021, President Xi Jinping took the most decisive step towards making it a reality, announcing a new pilot program to be rolled out in several cities across China. This decision feeds into the ‘common prosperity’ drive, as homeownership - in particular investment-driven purchases of second and third homes - is widely considered a source of wealth inequality in China. The property tax, in theory, would provide another stream of income to local governments, diversifying away from a reliance on land sales and LGFVs. However, questions remain as to whether a property tax would be able to effectively replace the funds raised from land sales, which still in areas where such taxes are already levied. In addition, a nationwide property tax would , which could, in turn, impact the real estate sector as property becomes a less lucrative investment option, which could then further impact land sales. Currently, however, the property tax has been levied mainly for commercial purposes, and excluded residential properties, therefore it is unclear how much local governments would be able to raise through universal residential property taxes."

Another report by UBS offers the following possible policies that could be implemented: further loosening restrictions on housing and development loans, relaxing capital market financing restrictions for developers, adjusting land transfer policies, and accelerating the construction of public rental housing. The central government could also ease fiscal and monetary policies for local governments to promote infrastructure spending - although it is not certain it will do this, as it has consistently repeated the need for a “proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy”.

Official ties date back to 1949 when China established relations with the former Czechoslovakia, and they continued seamlessly when Slovakia became an independent state in 1993. Over the decades, economic cooperation has been a cornerstone of bilateral relations, further deepened by China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the China – Central and Eastern European (CEE) cooperation framework. Marking 75 years of diplomatic relations in 2024, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico’s official visit to China underscored the growing strategic partnership between the two nations."

            "Since 2022, bilateral trade between China and Slovakia has been on a declining trend, driven by several key factors. One major challenge has been global supply chain pressures and high inflation. In 2023, the global economic recovery remained sluggish, with supply chain disruptions and rising energy prices increasing business costs and dampening trade demand. As an EU member state, Slovakia has faced weakened import demand due to Europe’s high inflation and slower economic growth. Structural trade imbalances have also played a role. China has traditionally maintained a trade deficit with Slovakia, but the gap has been narrowing. In 2024, China’s trade deficit with Slovakia stood at US$1.83 billion, a 27.5 percent reduction from the previous year. This shift reflects a sharper decline in China’s imports from Slovakia compared to its exports, potentially linked to the declining competitiveness of key Slovak exports such as automotive parts."

            "China successfully hosted the Olympic Winter Games in February 2022, despite the myriad health and logistical challenges posed by COVID-19. The threat of the virus partly overshadowed China’s accomplishments in transforming into a winter sports power, adding to the country’s momentum towards becoming a fitness conscious society. In the 2022 Winter Olympics, China won nine gold medals and 15 medals in total, up from one and nine, respectively, in the previous Winter Olympics in South Korea. China’s newfound success in winter sports reflects the government’s ability to channel resources into building the talent and infrastructure needed to develop world class athletes. The 14th Five Year Plan for Sports Development, which covers the years 2021 to 2025, seeks to build China into a global sports power, demonstrating the government’s ambitions for athletic development. These goals extend not just to elite athletes, but also the wider population, as the government is increasingly encouraging fitness to address prevalent social and health issues."

            "Plans to boost fitness accessibility",
            "China’s to achieve Winter Olympic success involved heavy investments in infrastructure and talent development, alongside recruiting overseas talent. Development of the fitness industry is similarly state-driven, meaning that adaptation to the priority areas identified by the government can lead to success for foreign businesses.",
            "Like with China’s Olympic strategy, the government has several plans in place to guide the development of fitness. Among the most important is the National Fitness Plan, released by the State Council in July 2021. The plan covers the years 2021 to 2025 and contains ambitious goals for China to accomplish by 2025. These include to reach 38.5 percent of the population regularly exercising, an increase of 1.3 percentage points compared to the previous five-year plan. One way the plan seeks to achieve this is to enhance fitness accessibility throughout the country. The plan seeks to have more than two sports instructors available to every 1,000 residents, to create or expand 2,000 fitness venues, and to replenish more than 5,000 fitness venues. By 2025, China plans to have full coverage of fitness facilities across all counties, towns, and villages, meaning all citizens should be no more than a 15-minute walk from a place to work out. The plan also has special provisions for particular demographics. According to the plan, students should have two hours a day for sports and fitness, including at least one hour of off-campus sports. For the elderly, the plan recommends that governments promote activities suitable for such populations, reduce barriers to access, and improve facilities for rehabilitation and people with disabilities. The plan also has measures for other target groups, including women and farmers. Besides improving people’s health, policy planners expect that increasing access to fitness resources will contribute to the fitness industry’s growth. Overall, the plan aims to increase the value of the sports industry to RMB 5 trillion (US$784.8 billion). In 2019, it was worth RMB 2.95 trillion (US$463.0 billion), according to the National Bureau of Statistics."

Proposed additions to the law include a new section on anti-doping, stipulations to increase fitness participation rates, and promoting fitness classes in schools. In 2019, the State Council released guidelines to implement the Healthy China 2030 initiative, with an action plan covering 2019 to 2030. The initiative focuses on the healthcare benefits of active lifestyles, which contribute to disease prevention and management of chronic diseases. Specifically, the initiative stresses the importance of healthy habits — like regular exercise, healthy diets, and avoidance of drinking and smoking — to prevent psychological health, myopia, childhood obesity, diabetes, and other health conditions. Other relevant laws include the Regulations on Public Cultural and Sports Facilities, the Regulations on Anti-Doping, the Regulations on National Fitness, the Guiding Opinions on Accelerating the Promotion of National Youth Ice and Snow Sports in School."

One of the reasons that Chinese regulators have put restrictions on private tutoring, excessive homework, and video game usage is the hope that these regulations will encourage youths to spend more time on physical activity. According to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 10 percent of youths under the age of six and 19 percent between the ages of six and 17 are overweight or obese. Engaging youths in physical activity can be challenging, however, especially for those living in dense urban environments without sufficient public sports infrastructure. To navigate these challenges, service providers can offer team-oriented social communities and app-based gamification that integrate online and offline fitness experiences. These principles are integral to Keep, one of the fitness apps in the Chinese market, which has over 42 million active users – about 60 percent of whom are under the age of 30.",

As the Chinese population ages, there will be increasing demand for fitness services that integrate rehabilitation and care of chronic conditions into fitness services, taking a page from occupational therapy best practices. Moreover, a more active elderly population will lead to higher demand for fitness apparel and accessories tailored to their unique accessibility needs. Emphasis on personalized coaching and accessibility is essential to reach elderly Chinese who did not grow up with the gym equipment commonly used by younger generations."

To put things into perspective, throughout the same month, NPPA approved 999 domestic games and only 30 from overseas. The government clarified the renewed importance of game content, given the widespread \"lack of originality, culture, social responsibility, and a misdirection of values\". Further new rules issued included real-name registration for online gaming, a curfew for online gamers under the age of 18, and spending limits."

            "China’s existing pension system is ill-suited to address these demographic changes. The system is formed of three pillars, in which the first pillar is the basic state pension and the second is the voluntary employee pension plan in which the employer and employee make monthly contributions. The third pillar is private pensions, which is currently very underdeveloped. The vast majority of people in China are covered by the first two pillars. Moreover, as the population continues to age, the first two pillars of the pension system are coming under considerable pressure and may be unable to support the population in a couple of decades' time. The state-sponsored pension is partly funded by individual income tax, but this source will become smaller as the working-age population shrinks. The national pension fund is expected to go into a deficit of RMB 118.13 billion (US$18 billion) in 2028, according to (CASS) (link in Chinese). Meanwhile, the employer-sponsored pension scheme only covers approximately 20 million employees, according to a report by . According to the report, the majority of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are unable to pay annuities to employees due to high operational costs, and many don’t even pay the mandatory social security for their employees. Falling birth rates also mean that many elderly will have no children to lean upon for financial support, who have traditionally taken up the role of main family breadwinner after their parents retire. This situation is further exacerbated by the very early legal retirement ages in China - 60 for men, 55 for female white-collar workers, and 50 for female blue-collar workers - as earlier retirements mean less tax collected on wages and fewer years of contributions from the employer. The third pillar of private pensions is therefore urgently needed to ensure financial security and stability for the country’s elderly population."

            "How does the scheme work? To take part in the scheme, individuals can make voluntary contributions by setting up a personal pension account. The personal pension account must be opened through the “Personal Pension Information Management Service Platform” (the “Information Service Platform”). Yearly contributions are capped at RMB 12,000 (US$1,846). This limit will be adjusted in the future by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) based on factors such as economic and social development. After setting up an account, participants can use their pension contributions to purchase financial products from eligible financial institutes. Only one account can be set up per participant, through which all transactions will be handled, including contributions, earnings from investments, payments, and tax payments. The personal account can be designated or opened in an eligible commercial bank or through an eligible financial product sales agency."

As previously mentioned, the funds in the personal pension accounts can be used to purchase eligible financial products, such as wealth management products, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance, and public funds. According to the opinions, the financial institutions and financial products permitted to be involved in the operation of individual pensions will be determined by the relevant financial regulatory authorities and released to the public through the service platform. However, no criteria for the permitted financial institutions or products have been given at this time, other than that the financial products must be \"safe, mature and stable, standardized, and focusing on long-term value preservation\". The opinions specifically call on various government departments to formulate relevant guidelines and regulations to facilitate the growth of the industry. The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the MOF will be expected to provide macro guidance for the development of personal pensions and formulate specific policies for matters such as establishing accounts, payment caps, treatment receipts, and tax incentives. Meanwhile, the relevant financial regulatory authorities will be required to supervise and guide the business aspects of the industry, including overseeing the participation of financial institutions in the operation of personal pensions. They will also help to urge relevant financial institutions to optimize products and services, provide product risk warnings, supervise the risks of products, and strengthen investor education. In a sign that more policy guidance is soon to come, a (link in Chinese) released on the official China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) website stated that the financial regulator would work to formulate and implement supporting rules and regulations for personal pension investment in public funds."

In February of this year, BlackRock’s wealth management JV with China Construction Bank (CCB), called BlackRock CCB Wealth Management, was by the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) to provide WMPs in two Chinese cities as part of a private pension pilot program. China has recently approved a host of wealth management JVs. These include a foreign-controlled wealth management JV between Goldman Sachs and ICBC and Amundi BOC Wealth Management, a JV between French asset management company Amundi and Bank of China’s wealth management subsidiary. Given the approval of BlackRock CCB Wealth Management to participate in the pension pilot scheme, it is likely more asset management JV corporations will be approved to provide WMPs to private pensioners."

Early movers with experience in providing products and services for pension funds are particularly well-positioned to gain from the opening of this market. At the same time, good policy directives and guidance will be required to ensure active participation by the public in the scheme. Policies such as tax incentives and education campaigns will be important to encourage the uptake of private pensions. Many potential customers will be unaccustomed to the idea of pension investments, as most private investment in China has traditionally gone into real estate. Building consumer trust and improving investment understanding and education will therefore be important strategies for companies seeking to make inroads into the space. Investors are also advised to closely monitor announcements from relative regulatory departments, including the CBIRC, CSRC, MOF, and MOHRSS, who are expected to provide more clarity and guidance on permitted and encouraged activity in the industry."

As a relatively broad concept, any economic form that directly or indirectly uses data and information technology to guide resource distribution and improve productivity can be categorized as being part of the digital economy.

To govern the energetic yet nascent sector, particularly the platform economy, China has rolled out multiple regulatory measures, addressing problems such as data abuse and monopolistic market behavior. These measures guarantee a fair market environment and improve governance while maintaining the sector’s vigor and innovation with high-speed growth. In February 2021, the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) published new anti-monopoly guidelines that aim to curb monopolistic behaviors by giant internet platforms and increase scrutiny of e-commerce marketplaces. The rules are meant to encourage fair competition and safeguard consumers. In June 2021, the Data Security Law (DSL) came into effect as a new pillar of China’s legal framework on information security and data privacy protection. The law focuses on data localization, data export, and data protection requirements. Effective from November 1, 2021, the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), along with the Data Security Law and Cybersecurity Law, further strengthens the legal realm of security and personal information protection.

On the one hand, although large technology enterprises have completed the early development of digital ecosystems and realized the digitalization of individual payments in various day-to-day consumption scenarios, consumers can only make online payments on the platforms owned by the corresponding payment platform’s parent company or other specific channels that the digital payment platform supports. Due to competition between different payment platforms and their parent companies, there is no single digital payment method that can support all scenarios - not even the super apps. In comparison, the digital yuan enjoys the same legal status as physical yuan and provides the public with a universal payment tool that can be used in all commercial scenarios. By integrating data held by different entities, the digital yuan can break the monopoly that large technology companies have on data, while providing an open environment for the smooth operation of the digital economy and better satisfy users’ needs."

Cultural attitudes toward keeping animals as pets began to shift along with increasingly relaxed views on marriage and children, at least among the younger generations. The first domestic pet brands and animal hospitals began to develop during this period, with a focus on cats and dogs in particular. The number of pets began to grow more significantly from 2010 onward, as millennials entered the workplace and increasingly formed so-called “dual income, no kids” (DINK) families, along with increased urbanization. Interest in more niche and exotic animals, such as reptiles, rodents, and aquatic animals, rose, and as China’s domestic e-commerce industry flourished, pet retail also began to move online, with platform companies, such as JD.com and Alibaba’s Taobao, offering pet products."

            "As more countries open their borders to international tourism, the absence of Chinese visitors is causing more than a little economic pain. From Phuket to Paris, major tourist destinations have relied on an average of 150 million Chinese travelers spending up to US$255 billion yearly on sightseeing. Now three years into the COVID-19 pandemic, many of these destinations are that it will be a while till the Chinese tourists return. Some analysts that this could impose serious economic consequences on affected countries. Despite the rest of the world moving toward an endemic approach to the virus, China continues to implement a zero-Covid policy. As of August 2022, China has a quarantine system in place for inbound travelers as well as rigorous measures that get promptly activated in case of outbreaks. Yet, it is precisely such measures that allow Chinese tourists to feel safer when traveling across provinces and have fueled the growth of the country’s domestic tourism industry."

            "Nevertheless, tourism market data from China in the first quarter of 2022 showed a significant dip when compared to the same period in the previous year. Data from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, for example, revealed that, during the New Year's Day and Spring Festival, 52 million and 251 million people traveled across the country between the two holidays, showing a year-on-year decrease of 5.3 percent and 2.0 percent, respectively. This of course can be put down to the resurgence of Covid-19 with multiple regional and global outbreaks due to more infectious variants. However, with the beginning of the summer holiday season, the slowdown appears to have once again reversed as ticket sales are noticeably on the rise. This presents us with a unique opportunity to zoom in on China’s tourism market and explore how it has transformed since the pandemic. We discuss who is the new Chinese traveler, look at destination trends, as well as the types of services required by the tourism market."

The released by Ctrip (one of China's leading travel companies) showed that family travel packages have reached a peak in the 2022 summer booking spree. In July 2022, the number of family air tickets sold increased by 804 percent, compared to the previous month. Similarly, bookings of family-friendly hotels grew 80 percent, compared to the same period in 2021, and were up by 20 percent from 2019 – most of these bookings being concentrated in four- and five-star hotels."

The backlog of travel demand from these places was primarily due to the impact of the epidemic response in the first half of the year, which gradually eased at the beginning of summer. Looking at the preferred travel destinations, families with children in primary or junior high schools prefer island tours to Sanya, Haikou, Qingdao, and Xiamen, among others, largely because of their family-friendly services. These two groups of travelers have also turned their attention to the tours to the northwestern provinces of Qinghai, Gansu, and Xinjiang. The Ctrip air ticket data also showed that younger travelers were accompanied by more family members. For example, primary and junior high school students travel with 3.5 and 3.2 people in summer vacations, respectively. On the other hand, college students are more independent in their travel habits."

            "Regulatory framework and compliance requirements for cloud businesses in China Since identifying cloud computing as a critical emerging sector in 2010, the Chinese government has strategically invested in and supported China's growth of cloud computing. When the State Council published the goals of the 12th Five Year Plan (12th FYP) (from 2011 to 2015) for fostering cloud computing, key government departments responded with detailed proposals for how to meet the requirements. Provincial and local governments, research institutions, businesses, research laboratories, and supporting organizations in turn all produced their own development plans in line with the interests of the central government. Prior to 2016, there were no specific laws and regulations governing cloud computing services in China. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) then released a (\"2015 Telecoms Catalogue\") which became effective in 2016. The law was then amended in 2019. Although \"cloud service\" or \"computing\" are not defined in the 2015 Telecoms Catalogue either, it is widely acknowledged that the phrase \"internet resource co-ordination services\" (IRCS; in Chinese: 互联网资源协作服务业务) in the catalogue refers to cloud services. The definition of IRCS in the 2015 Telecoms Catalogue is \"Data storage, internet application development environment, deployment, and operation management, as well as other services provided for users through the internet or other networks in the manners of access at any time and on-demand, expansion at any time, and coordination and sharing, by using the equipment and resources built on database centers\". Along with the catalogue, the MIIT additionally published the (in Chinese: 关于规范云服务市场经营行为的通知) in November 2016. In this document, it is explicitly stated that \"cloud service\" is one type of IRCS mentioned in the 2015 Telecoms Catalogue."

Providing such VATS in China requires licensing. Therefore, the operation of cloud services in China requires a special VATS license for IDC businesses (also known as an IDC license). Because all three types of cloud services - IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS - are included in the Chinese definition of IRCSs, each of these cloud services must operate with a VATS license specifically designated for their IDC activity. Some SaaS service types may be operated without a VATS license if they are deemed to be \"pure software services\" and do not incorporate additional VATS as defined by the 2015 Telecoms Catalogue.

However, ever since China's accession to the WTO, IDC services have never been directly open to foreign investment. As a result, foreign businesses have not been able to receive licensing. On the other hand, Chinese authorities have confirmed the eligibility of investors from Hong Kong and Macao for IDC licenses in the separate Closer Economic Partnership Arrangements (CEPA) that China has co-signed with the two special administrative regions. Each CEPA agreement enables investors from Hong Kong and Macao to form joint venture companies in China with Chinese investors to offer IDC services. There are no geographical restrictions on the delivery of the IDC services within China, and the shareholding of service providers from Hong Kong and Macao in these joint ventures cannot exceed 50 percent.

Through those contracts, the WFOE can acquire indirect influence over the management of the VIE entity as well as the vast bulk of its income.

Three of the top seven worldwide public cloud IaaS market service providers – Jinshan, Tencent, and Alibaba cloud – are Chinese, according to a 2020 from IDC. At the same time, startup SaaS businesses are multiplying quickly. Internet vendors are leveraging collaborative office tools like DingTalk to provide a platform to offer customers industry solutions. In the next few years, the ecosystem of China’s SaaS market is bound to be refined, and the industry's service capability will improve rapidly. Cloud suppliers in China need to focus on providing higher technical performance while also ensuring data security. The government support for digital transformation resulted in increased cloud adoption in more traditional sectors. Thus, the industry's future depends in part on conventional businesses adopting cloud services. In conclusion, foreign cloud providers entering the Chinese market should follow in the footsteps of larger companies, partnering with Chinese firms and learning from their best practices."

            "The paper fapiao system has remained in place for many years.",
            "However, the methodology has come under increased strain in recent years from high-frequency transaction industries, such as retail, food and beverage, and travel.",

My salary was RMB 10,000 per month for the whole time. Will this situation have an impact on my 2021 IIT calculation and payment? Does this situation involve tax return or tax owed? How should I file it? There are two kinds of tax identity for foreigners working in China, each with its own calculation method. Simply put, those who stay in China for more than 183 days will be regarded as resident individuals, while those who stay less than 183 days will be regarded as non-resident individuals. The company where the foreigner is an employee will evaluate and estimate the expat's ‘days in China’ and choose the tax identity at the beginning of the year. In your case, you were originally regarded as a resident individual in terms of your tax identity in 2020 (the cumulative period in China is more than 183 days in 2020). In 2021, you stayed in China for less than 183 days. Hence your tax identity shall switch from resident individual to non-resident individual. As the calculations for the two tax identities are different, it is possible to have tax owed."

            "Insights from Dezan Shira & Associates: Historically, similar stamp tax incentives were introduced in 2003, but their scope was limited, supporting only a few scenarios such as enterprise restructuring, mergers, and splits. The new MOF and STA Announcement No.14 marks a significant breakthrough by expanding the scope to include enterprise restructuring, reorganization, bankruptcy liquidation, and institutional reform, thereby increasing policy support for restructuring activities.",
            "A notable new measure is the exemption of stamp tax on property transfer documents for internal transfers of land use rights, buildings, and equity within the same investment entity. Previously, there were inconsistencies in local interpretations regarding the exemption of stamp tax for such internal transfers. This clarification is a significant benefit for relevant enterprises.",
            "Compared to the 2003 policy, another major highlight of the MOF and STA Announcement No.14 is the removal of the requirement for restructuring to be approved by county-level or higher government authorities and enterprise supervisory departments. This change broadens the applicability of stamp tax incentives to include private enterprises, reflecting policy fairness and unity, and stimulating the vitality of various business entities. Removing unnecessary restrictions also promotes the construction of a unified national market.",
            "To ensure that relevant enterprises fully benefit from these stamp tax incentives, the policy adopts a “self-assessment, declaration, and retention of relevant materials for future reference” approach. When advancing restructuring efforts, enterprises and institutions should closely monitor policy changes and fully utilize the available tax incentives to optimize the reform process."

            "China’s legislature has adopted an amendment to the country’s , passing sweeping changes to company capital rules, corporate governance structures, liquidation procedures, and shareholder rights, among others. The new version of the Company Law will come into force on July 1, 2024.",
            "The new version of the China Company Law will have significant implications for companies in China. Below we analyze the impact of the law from a tax and financial perspective.",
            "Tax Implications of the Amendments to the Company Law",
            "Amendments to the Company Law | Potential tax implications",
            "Capital contribution form | Article 48 of the new Company Law adds that shareholder may make capital contributions in stock rights and creditor's rights, in addition to the previously forms, including cash, or in kind, intellectual property rights, land use rights, and other non-monetary properties that can be valued in currency and transferred legally. | If an individual shareholder transfers his equity to a newly established company as capital contribution, he shall pay Individual income tax (IIT) in accordance with Article 17 of the Regulations for the Implementation of the Individual Income Tax Law of the People's Republic of China on income from property transfer. If the transferor is a company, the company will be subject to corporate income tax (CIT) based on normal tax treatment or special tax treatment. The transfer of creditor's rights is also subject to income tax according to law. And capital contribution by creditor’s rights in the form of bonds (state bonds, local government bonds, financial bonds and corporate bonds) shall be regarded as financial products transfer and thus subject to value-added tax (VAT). In the process of transferring assets such as equity and creditor's rights, it may also involve debt restructuring between enterprises, and the tax treatment involved is more complex. Meanwhile, capital contribution in non-monetary assets is eligible for certain preferential tax treatment. Enterprises should strictly abide by the relevant regulations and do tax planning work in advance.",
            "Capital contribution terms | Article 47 of the new Company Law requires stipulates shareholders of a Limited Liability Company (LLC) must pay their subscribed capital in full within five years of the company’s establishment. Previously, there is no time limit for the capital contribution. | For enterprises that have not paid enough capital, the amount of loan interest that cannot be deducted before tax needs to be more accurately accounted for. Where an enterprise investor fails to pay in full the amount of its capital payable within the prescribed time limit, the interest incurred on the external loan of the enterprise is equivalent to the interest payable for the difference between the amount of capital paid in by the investor and the amount of capital payable within the prescribed time limit, which is not a reasonable expenditure of the enterprise and shall be borne by the enterprise investor and shall not be deducted when calculating the taxable income of the enterprise.",
            "Equity transfer | Article 88, Paragraph 1 of the adds that where a shareholder transfers the equities for which capital contributions have been subscribed for but the time limit for capital contribution has not expired, the transferee shall bear the obligation of making such capital contribution. If the transferee fails to make a capital contribution on time and in full amount, the transferor shall bear the supplementary liability for the overdue capital contribution of the transferee. | The obligation of the transferee to assume the contributions for the transferor should be considered as part of the consideration for the equity transfer when calculating capital gains, and corresponding IIT or CIT should be paid.",
            "Capital reduction | Article 214 adds that the reserve of a company shall be used for making up losses. Where the reserve of a company is used for making up losses, the discretionary reserve and statutory reserve shall be firstly used. If losses still cannot be made up, the capital reserve can be used according to the relevant provisions. | On the one hand, after making up losses with capital reserve, the overall tax burden of enterprises may increase. This is because after making up losses, the company will also have taxable income in the following profit years, as compared to when the company still has losses on record. On the other hand, it’s yet to be clarified whether using capital reserve to make up losses itself is taxable or not.",
            "Against the backdrop of the new Company Law, companies, shareholders, and creditors will face new tax implications. Before committing capital to a new company, deciding the contribution form, deciding to buy or sell the equity in a company, or planning to reduce capital for making up losses, companies and individual investors are advised to carefully consider the corresponding tax implications and adopt a cautious yet proactive approach for tax planning and financial strategy development.",

            "On January 4, 2024, the People's Bank of China, the MOF, and the STA jointly issued the (the Notice), which will take effect on February 18, 2024. This Notice aims to further standardize cross-border tax and fee collection and refund operations, enhance the convenience of cross-border tax payments, and optimize the business environment.",
            "It is noted that cross-border tax payment into the treasury is divided into two types: cross-border tax payment into the treasury in foreign currency and cross-border tax payment into the treasury in RMB. Cross-border taxes can be paid into the treasury by the Treasury Information Processing System (TIPS) or through transfer. If the TIPS method is adopted, the payer needs to declare taxes to the tax authorities, and tax payment can be made and queried at the bank's end. If the method of transfer is selected, the payer needs to declare taxes to the tax authorities, and the tax authority will then notify the payer to accurately fill out the relevant information of the remittance voucher.",
            "Cross-Border Tax and Fee Payment and Refund Process for Non-Resident Taxpayers",
            "Payment | Refund",
            "Payment TIPS: * Taxpayers submit tax declarations to tax authorities, selecting bank-side tax payment through TIPS for electronic payment. * Taxpayers remit the tax payment to the domestic Treasury's collection account. * If the remittance amount exceeds the required tax payment, the Treasury's collection office should promptly refund the excess amount (after deducting exchange fees) to the original remittance account. If the remittance amount is less than the required tax payment, the Treasury's collection office informs the tax authority of the shortfall in the taxpayer's funds in RMB. The tax authority notifies the taxpayer to promptly make up the shortfall, and the Treasury's collection office processes the payment after the funds are replenished according to regulations.",
            "Payment by transfer: * Taxpayers must submit tax declarations to tax authorities. * The tax authority will then notify the payer to accurately fill out the relevant information of the remittance voucher. * Taxpayer remit taxes to the \"Pending Tax Payment\" special account of the Treasury through the Treasury's collection office.",
            "Applicants initiate a refund request. After the tax authority approves the refund application, they issue a tax revenue refund certificate and related documents, submitting them to the relevant Treasury. After verification by the Treasury, the refund procedures are completed, and the remittance information is transmitted to the Treasury's collection office. The refund funds are then transferred to the Treasury's collection office. The Treasury's collection office is required to transfer the funds (after deducting exchange fees) to the overseas taxpayer's account on the same day or the next morning after receiving the remittance information and refund funds.",
            "In the past, when non-resident taxpayers made cross-border tax payments, especially in cases involving paying taxes in foreign currencies, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the time of exchange and the actual payment often led to various issues. For instance, if the RMB-denominated tax payment, after conversion, did not meet the declared tax amount due to exchange rate fluctuations, the tax authority could not issue a complete tax payment certificate. Conversely, following the currency exchange, if there was a surplus in the RMB-denominated tax payment after deducting relevant exchange fees, it often involved a lengthy process to apply for a refund, with refund procedures proving challenging.",
            "The Notice alleviates such problems of non-resident taxpayers overpaying taxes due to exchange rate issues, by providing clarity and convenience for non-resident taxpayer’s tax payments and facilitating timely and effective refunds."
